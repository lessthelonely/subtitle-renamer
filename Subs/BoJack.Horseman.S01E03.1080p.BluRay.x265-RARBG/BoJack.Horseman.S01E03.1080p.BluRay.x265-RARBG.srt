00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:12,429
[Bojack] Who wants
chocolate chip pancakes?

2
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:14,014
I do! I do!

3
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,558
Ethan, didn't you already eat
your pancakes?

4
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:19,520
As Oliver north would say,
“I do not recall."

5
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:20,896
[Canned laughter]

6
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:22,940
Hey, where's Sabrina?

7
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:26,026
Not hiding under the table,
that's for sure.

8
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:27,569
[Audience] Aww...

9
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,614
Why don't you guys
leave this one to me?

10
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:32,866
Why aren't you dressed
for school, prickly muffin?

11
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,826
I'm scared. Olivia told me

12
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:37,246
sometimes, at school
they have pop quizzes.

13
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,414
I don't want to pop!

14
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:42,376
That's too much, man.

15
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,086
[Canned laughter and applause]

16
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:47,714
[Laughs] Sabrina,
nobody's popping on my watch.

17
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,050
You stick with me,
and I promise you,

18
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:52,427
everything's gonna be just fine.

19
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,806
- Cut, boom in the shot.
- What? I'll be in my trailer.

20
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,057
[Canned laughter]

21
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,142
Nah, I'm just horsin' around.

22
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,703
[Canned laughter and applause]
[Laughs]

23
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,355
You folks enjoying the show?
[Crowd cheering]

24
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:06,525
And how about Sara Lynn
as Sabrina? Isn't she wonderful?

25
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:09,570
- [Cheers and applause]
- Oh. [Chuckles] Thank you.

26
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,030
Sarah Lynn.
You remember that name.

27
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,365
Back to one, everybody.

28
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:15,284
- Hey, you see those people?
- Yeah.

29
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,743
Well, those boobs and jerk wads

30
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,390
are the best friends
you'll ever have.

31
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,289
Without them, you're nothing.
Remember that.

32
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,624
Let's take it back
to "prickly muffin."

33
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,271
Your family will never
understand you,

34
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:26,461
your lovers will leave you
or try to change you,

35
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,255
but your fans,
you be good to them,

36
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:29,502
and they'll be good to you.

37
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,508
We are rolling. Sound speed.

38
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,969
The most important thing is,
you got to give the people

39
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:36,096
what they want,
even if it kills you,

40
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,974
even if it empties you out until
there's nothing left to empty.

41
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:41,351
No matter what happens,
no matter how much it hurts,

42
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,563
you don't stop dancing,
and you don't stop smiling,

43
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,232
and you give those people
what they want.

44
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:48,942
And action.

45
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,278
Why aren't you dressed
for school, prickly muffin?

46
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,700
You might remember her
as adorable Sabrina

47
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,870
from horsin'around,
but on her new dance pop album,

48
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:03,206
Sarah Lynn wants you to know
that she is hot to trot.

49
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:08,128
J“ why don't you touch
my prickly muffin? J“

50
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,506
j“ my prickly muffin j“

51
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,009
j“ ooh, prickly,
and it's muffin, and it's... j“

52
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:15,469
[gasps]

53
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,930
J“ it's ready
for your stuffing j“

54
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,683
what is the message
behind your music?

55
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,811
America needs to know that I'm
not that little girl anymore.

56
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,899
I'm a grown up, sophisticated
woman now, and I have sex,

57
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,484
and I do sexy things.

58
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,195
People like sex, okay,

59
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:36,198
and since I'm sexy right now,
they like me.

60
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:38,445
Are you at all worried
that audiences will grow bored

61
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,410
and abandon you
for the next sexy thing?

62
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,121
[Chuckles] Are you kidding?
I'm Sarah freaking Lynn.

63
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,082
I'm gonna be sexy forever!

64
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,753
Pop star and child actress,
Sarah Lynn,

65
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,172
celebrates her 30th birthday
this month,

66
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,049
raising the question,
"does anyone care

67
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:57,469
about Sarah Lynn anymore?"
After all, she is 30.

68
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:59,221
Here to answer that question,

69
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:03,016
sexy, 14-year-old dubstep
wunderkind, sextina aquafina.

70
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,851
Hey! [Applause]

71
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,561
Sextina, what's your take?

72
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,439
I love Sarah Lynn.
I grew up on her music, okay,

73
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,067
and she's, like, an inspiration,
but now, she is old,

74
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:14,504
and shriveled, and gross, and
nobody want her no more, okay?

75
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:17,072
They want sextina aquafina,
baby!

76
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,573
Ha ha! You're delightful.

77
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,118
So where does Sarah Lynn
go from here?

78
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,994
Oh, you know where
she should go?

79
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,746
She should go
wherever famous people go

80
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,153
when they're done being famous,

81
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,667
and nobody cares
if they live or die.

82
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,585
[Horse whinnying doorbell ringing]

83
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,380
Who could that be?

84
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,383
[Funky electronic music]

85
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,521
Who-o-o wants
chocolate chip pancakes?

86
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,690
I do! I do!

87
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,233
Why are you talking to me?

88
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,640
I thought maybe if I said that,

89
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,403
you'd make me
chocolate chip pancakes.

90
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,990
- [Grumbles]
- Oh, come on, buddy.

91
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,576
It's a beautiful morning,
the sun is shining,

92
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,536
- birds are chirping...
- Hey, bojack,

93
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,765
- any plans for the weekend?
- Still hate the troops, boj?

94
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,224
Why don't you refill
your bird feeder, huh?

95
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,750
Yeah, who's a bird got to blow

96
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,770
- to get some seed around here?
- [Chuckles] Good one.

97
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,754
Let's do something fun today.

98
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,840
- Like what?
- Like a cannonball!

99
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:04,554
Like a “buying you a new bed"?

100
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,099
Wow, everything in this store
is made

101
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,477
out of old train tracks
and a reclaimed pier.

102
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,104
Oh, great, for ten grand,
I can sleep like a hobo.

103
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,356
Do we need letter openers

104
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,441
made out of confederate
bayonets?

105
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,544
It says they're stained
with authentic yankee blood.

106
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:25,158
O-m-g. O-m-g!
O-m-m-f-c-s-d-v-r-q-q-p-q-f-g!

107
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,577
- I know.
- Ugh.

108
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,788
Yeah, it's me,
straight off your TV screens

109
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,373
and into your shitty lives.

110
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,042
It's Sarah Lynn
and Andrew Garfield.

111
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,503
[Screams] Huh? What the...?

112
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,455
And what's your name, darling?

113
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,425
I... mm...

114
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,469
I'll just make it out
to "Evelyn."

115
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,431
Um, hi. Sarah Lynn, hi.

116
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:53,687
Bojack? Hey. Andrew,
this is bojack, my TV dad.

117
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,814
Oh, hello, I'm Andrew Garfield.

118
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:59,359
Andrew's my boyfriend.
We're a celebrity power couple.

119
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:00,777
It's no big deal.

120
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,654
[Whispering]
It's a really big deal.

121
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:05,073
Sarah Lynn, I actually wanted
to talk to you about that.

122
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,284
When we started dating,
you were the biggest star

123
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,036
in the world,
but your last few albums tanked,

124
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,665
so now, I don't even know
what you are anymore.

125
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:17,460
Are you... are you breaking up
with me?

126
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,504
Oh, bother.

127
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,131
Um, are those candy pills,

128
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:23,049
'cause if so,
that is a lot of sugar.

129
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,759
Why are you doing this to me?

130
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,470
Do you like seeing me suffer?

131
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,765
Because you know
I'll bleed for you.

132
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,017
Ugh! [All gasp]

133
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,268
- Oh!
- Damn!

134
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,979
- Oh, dear.
- Whoa-oh-oh. Um...

135
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,266
Darling, please, I wanted
to do this in a public place

136
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,900
so you wouldn't make a scene.

137
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,069
You think I won't make
a scene, you limey bastard?

138
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,280
Then you really
don't know me at all.

139
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:48,617
Hey, everyone!
Who wants to see me take a dump

140
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,160
on that sofa?

141
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,955
And then she took a dump
on a sofa

142
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,433
made out of a reclaimed
propeller.

143
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,167
Where's Sarah Lynn now?

144
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,836
I checked her into promises.
28 days, she'll be good as new.

145
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,230
How did it feel
to check the girl

146
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,654
you raised on television
into rehab?

147
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:03,965
It was tough.

148
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,693
I would have liked
to reconnect with her.

149
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,904
At least we got to bond a little
on the drive to Malibu.

150
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,888
I can see my organs.

151
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:13,391
Oh, whoa! She is losing
a lot of blood, bojack.

152
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,310
Beautiful day for a drive,
though, huh?

153
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:16,895
Well, maybe the two of you

154
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,998
can catch up some more
when she gets out of rehab.

155
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,566
People don't usually want to
hang out with me after rehab.

156
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,027
I'm really more
of a before-rehab friend.

157
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:25,474
I think it's gonna be
a long time

158
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,770
before I see Sarah Lynn again.

159
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,323
[Horse whinnying doorbell ringing]

160
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,450
Who could that be?

161
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,871
Look, bojack, I appreciate
what you were trying to do,

162
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,667
but I don't need rehab.
Look, good as new, huh?

163
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,252
Oh, great,
well, that's a relief.

164
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,254
Uh, should you be taking
all those pills?

165
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,881
It's dexitriathylphenolbarbatol.

166
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:48,093
- I got it from a doctor.
- Your doctor or just a doctor?

167
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,095
I don't know, some doctor, okay?

168
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,347
I met him at Adam levine's
Halloween party.

169
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,349
I think he said

my problems head on,

for a little bit?

I hear what you're saying,

182
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,797
and I think I know
what you need.

183
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,091
You just need
a strong, responsible adult

Yes, you can move in with me."

you've earned the guest room.

going to the mall's a good idea?

you went shopping

pretty out of control.

as a third-wave feminist

278
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,838
if it's even possible for women
to reclaim their sexuality

279
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,882
in this deeply entrenched
patriarchal society,

280
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,843
or if claiming to do so
is just a lie we tell ourselves

281
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,947
so we can more comfortably cater
to the male gaze.

282
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,639
- Uh, what?
- But you know,

283
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:47,392
on the other hand, I worry
that conversations like this one

284
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,638
often dismiss her as a mere
puppet of the industry...

285
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,497
- That's my same worry.
- Incapable of engaging

- in these discussions herself...
- Obviously.

287
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,067
And infantilization,
which is itself a product

- of the deeply misogynistic...
- So deep.

about her living here?

00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,795
Oh, hey, bojack.

336
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,731
I told my friends they could
tear this wall out to build

337
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:42,757
a sweet cocaine booth/sex
closet.

338
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:44,926
- Is that cool?
- No, that's not cool.

339
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:47,011
Oof. Way to harsh the vibe,
kissinger.

340
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:49,931
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize.

341
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:52,433
I thought this was a place
where Sarah Lynn

342
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,354
could finally be Sarah Lynn,
but I guess...

343
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,523
That's too much, man.

344
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,192
I always loved
that catch phrase.

345
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,799
Can your friends at least take
the artwork off the wall first?

346
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,782
Ooh. I want to say yes, but no.

347
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:10,910
- Okay, good talk.
- Wha... are you serious?

348
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,876
The reason I have called
this house meeting is...

349
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,878
Todd, how many times
have we been over this?

350
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,381
You don't have the authority
to call house meetings.

351
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:27,093
Only I can call a house meeting.
You can propose a house meeting.

352
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,238
All right, fine, fine, fine,
but the reason I propose

353
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,823
- this house meeting...
- Your proposal has been

354
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,932
submitted and
is under board review.

355
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,393
- Proposal denied.
- Bojack, this Sarah Lynn thing

356
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,813
is getting out of control, okay?
She's taking advantage of you.

357
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,524
What? No she's not.
We have a special relationship.

358
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,276
You couldn't possibly
understand.

359
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,528
Oh, my god. Look at what
she's done to your house.

360
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,756
All right, look, I mean,
I stepped on a needle earlier.

361
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,198
I think I'm addicted
to heroin now,

362
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,659
so now, that's probably
gonna be a whole thing.

363
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:53,578
I have to say,
I agree with Todd.

364
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,347
You're not this girl's father,
and you're not doing her

365
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,457
any favors by refusing
to set boundaries.

366
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,834
Look, I played a dad
for nine years on TV,

367
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,979
so I think I know a little bit
more about parenting

368
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:04,005
than you two jokers.
The kids on horsin'around

369
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:05,631
didn't need boundaries.

370
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,092
All they needed was
some good, old-fashioned love.

371
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,678
Bojack!
This is not a TV show, okay?

372
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,597
This is real life.

373
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,892
Ah! Lemur on fire!
Lemur on fire!

374
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,814
Some good, old-fashioned love,
and I'm gonna give it to her.

375
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,942
I'm gonna give it to her
so... hard.

376
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:28,529
You know, I feel like
we don't ever hang out.

377
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,492
Here you are, milady,

378
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,620
a gin and nutmeg
just like you asked.

379
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,580
Ugh. Too much nutmeg.

380
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,874
Well, you know what
would taste even better?

381
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,460
An endorsement
for a Slovakian yogurt.

382
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,587
Could Vanessa gecko
get you that?

383
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:48,549
Vanessa gecko got Andrew
the social network,

384
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,010
and she has skybox seats
at the staples center.

385
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,821
- What do you have?
- Well, I've got a table

386
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,531
at the comedy central roast
of Gloria Stein...

387
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,595
Hey, Sarah Lynn, what say
we spend the day together,

388
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,101
just you and me,
away from all the haters?

389
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,522
- I want to say yes, but...
- Great, let's go.

390
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,775
J“ it really seems like
some things are forever I

391
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,693
j“ in this world I

392
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,029
j“ don't you know
I'm feeling fine j”

393
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,657
j“ together with my girl j“

394
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:17,787
.i' daddy's girl
she's daddy's girl j“

395
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,207
you know, Sarah Lynn,
I got a feeling

396
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:24,794
- everything's gonna be okay.
- Uh-huh.

397
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,672
Hey, did you hear
kazaz got cancer?

398
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,590
What? Herb kazaz has cancer?

399
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,927
Yeah, in the butt. He's got,
like, six months I think.

400
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:35,304
Well, that's horrible.
Why would you tell me that now?

401
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,848
I don't know. The sun setting
over those two hills

402
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,868
made me think of a big ass,
and that made me think

403
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,477
of ass cancer,
and that made me think

404
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:44,730
of herb kazaz's ass cancer.
You really didn't know?

405
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,524
No, herb and I aren't
on the best...

406
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,776
Look, I'm trying to have
a moment here. I can't...

407
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,153
Hey, I want to give you
something.

408
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,030
Is this your TV guide award?

409
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,616
It's the most prestigious
award I ever won.

410
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,469
I always thought if I ever
had kids of my own,

411
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,121
I'd give it to them one day.
I want you to have it.

412
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:03,374
Oh, wow. Bojack, thanks.
You're sweet.

413
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:07,128
[Sighs]
J“ na-na-na-na la-ia-ia-ia j'

414
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:08,921
j“ na-na-na-na la-ia-ia-ia j“

415
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,506
- what are you doing?
- Shh.

416
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,234
Just let the credits roll,
let the credits roll.

417
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,969
J“ sha-na-na-na-na-na

418
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,680

419
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,599
j“ na-na-na such a happy day j“

420
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,267
“sit, ubu, sit."
“Good dog." "Arf."

421
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,894
- Can we go home now?
- Yeah, okay, we're done.

422
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:28,566
J“ hey now, boy, come and try
my clitoris is ginormous j“

423
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,737
[phone buzzing]

424
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,739
- Hello?
- Bojack horseman.

425
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,741
Did you get rid
of your old TV guide award?

426
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,587
This pawnshop on la cienega
was selling one

427
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:39,952
- with your name on it.
- What?

428
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,954
Wait, why were you
at a pawnshop?

429
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,681
Oh, I just have a guy there
who calls me

430
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,750
whenever TV awards come in
so I can buy 'em.

431
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,710
I put my name on,
it's like I won it myself!

432
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,337
I have two golden globes

433
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,547
and a people's choice
for temple grandin.

434
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,215
Sarah Lynn!

435
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,676
Hello? You still there?

436
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,471
J“ my clitoris is ginor... j“
[Record scratch]

437
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,014
Okay, party's over.
Everybody out.

438
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:01,641
- [All] Aw!
- Not you.

439
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,352
You are in big trouble,
young lady.

440
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,437
I can't believe
you pawned my award.

441
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:09,357
It wasn't personal. I just
thought your award was stupid,

442
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,192
and I already have
a billion other awards,

443
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,985
and I wanted to get money
for drugs.

444
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,072
Look, things have been tough
for you, and I understand that.

445
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,918
I know what you're
going through right now.

446
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,951
[Chuckling] Oh, you know
what I'm going through? Why?

447
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,746
Because you were on some dumb
kids show a million years ago?

448
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,956
- Hey, now.
- I had my own fashion line

449
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:29,418
when I was ten.
By 20, I was packing stadiums.

450
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,380
I get letters every day
from boys telling me

451
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,799
that I was the first girl
they masturbated to.

452
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,760
Literally, someone
tells me that every day.

453
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,721
- That is gross.
- Oh-ho, I know!

454
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,932
You sit up here
in your little house

455
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:46,060
and feel sorry for yourself?
Oh, guess what, Bo-j,

456
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,288
in order to be a has-been,
you have to have actually,

457
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,940
- you know, been.
- You are way out of line!

458
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,317
You're not my dad.
You're just a rugged, older man

459
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:55,486
who provided me with a strong,
masculine presence

460
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,071
during my formative years.

461
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:58,989
I'm not your dad,
and you're not my child.

462
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,659
We're just a man and a lady
living in a house together,

463
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:04,203
and we're both adults,
and we're both a little drunk.

464
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,416
[Both groaning]

465
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,295
Who-o-o lit my ottoman on fire?

466
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,298
Seriously,
you seriously don't know?

467
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,926
I'm a bad "widdle" girl.

468
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,178
Yeah, you are bad, very bad!

469
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:25,433
You want me to put it out
with my boob?

470
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,268
- Uh, what?
- Your boob

471
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:31,397
is a very impractical way
to put out a fire.

472
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:32,773
What is happening?

473
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,900
I think you have
a serious drug problem.

474
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,195
The only drug I need is horse.

475
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,822
Guys, guys, what are you doing?

476
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,299
Please don't do this.
[Both moaning]

477
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,409
No, no. Why are you...
[Both moaning]

478
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,286
- [Whinnies]
- This is a very bad idea.

479
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,139
[Both moaning]
Can I at least get my blanket...

480
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,683
Let me get my blanket
out from under...

481
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,291
Oh g... oh my god, my arm.

482
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,959
- You got my arm.
- [Laughs] Ow! Ow!

483
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:54,378
I'm in it now.
Oh, god, no! I'm a part of it.

484
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:01,135
I still haven't regained
the feeling in my fingers.

485
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:03,137
That was the longest two minutes
of my life.

486
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:05,848
Um, I think it was a little
longer than two minutes.

487
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,433
It was longer than two minutes.

488
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,519
How do you not get
that this is terrible?

489
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,229
Oh, you mean
from a PR. Standpoint?

490
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:15,149
Yeah, 'cause if this got out,
oh, I would get flayed!

491
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:18,360
Oh, I'm done being
the voice of reason.

492
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:22,072
It's exhausting.
I got to take an angry nap.

493
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,492
Ugh.ugh.ugh.

494
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,952
I know. I know.
She's taking advantage of me.

495
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,847
Actually, it kind of feels
like you're the one

496
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,414
taking advantage of her.
She's the one

497
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:32,917
with substance abuse problems
and daddy issues.

498
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,723
Hey, we both have
substance abuse problems

499
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,879
- and daddy issues.
- Yeah, but she came to you

500
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,965
- for help.
- [Sighs]

501
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,945
Hey, notice how
I've been ignoring you,

502
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,387
playing hard to get?
Only makes you want me more.

503
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,240
Ugh. Go stand
on the other side of the room.

504
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,099
- Okay.
- Sarah Lynn, get your coat.

505
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,310
- I'm taking you to rehab.
- Nah,

506
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,597
I was gonna keep hanging out
here if that's all right.

507
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,731
- No, it's not all right.
- What?

508
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:57,566
This place isn't good for you.

509
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,444
You need to go where you can
get help, real help.

510
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:02,696
But I thought you were always
gonna be there for me

511
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:03,948
like you said.

512
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,659
I will always be there for you.

513
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,369
Cut, let's take ten.

514
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:11,288
That's ten, everyone.
Let's make it a tight ten.

515
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:12,682
- These pages are shit.
- [Coughs]

516
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,124
You understand? Shit.

517
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,851
I wouldn't wipe my ass
with these pages.

518
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,687
It would defeat the whole
purpose of wiping my ass.

519
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,380
- Phone for you.
- Uh-huh.

520
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:21,006
You get me points
on the back end?

521
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,508
- [Coughs]
- Well, I told you

522
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:23,902
I'm not gonna do it
unless I get points.

523
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,344
Oh, they can't find any?

524
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:26,780
Well, maybe they could
suck some out of my dick!

525
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:28,013
- [Coughs]
- I'm on the phone.

526
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,975
- You're being very rude.
- [Laughs]

527
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,185
You promised me you would
always be there.

528
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,604
Sarah Lynn,
this is for your own good.

529
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,273
You can't stay here anymore.

530
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,400
Okie-doke.
I guess I'll just move out

531
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:40,887
and find
one of the billion people

532
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:42,695
who will let me party
at their house.

533
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,531
Uh, well,
you should not do that.

534
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:48,242
Oh, I know. I know,
but I can, so I will.

535
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:50,160
I'm at a place right now
where I never need

536
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:53,080
to grow as a person
or rise to an occasion

537
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,666
because I can constantly
just surround myself

538
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:58,252
with sycophants and enablers
until I die tragically young.

539
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:00,045
- Wh-what?
- Yeah,

540
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:03,215
it's pretty much
too late for me.

541
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,135
Well, them's the breaks.
Take it sleazy, everybody.

542
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:08,888
Oh, by the way,
I called Vanessa gecko,

543
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,556
and I'm meeting with her
tomorrow.

544
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,267
- Thanks for the suggestion.
- No! No, no, no, no, no!

545
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:16,478
Hey, you guys want to hear
my new catchphrase?

546
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:20,274
Suck a dick, dumb shits!
[Blows raspberry]

547
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:22,318
[Grunting]

548
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:25,154
Laura, the dummy took the bait.
Now for phase two.

549
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:28,949
Is she gone?
Is it safe to come out?

550
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,035
Leak to the trades
that Andrew Garfield's agent

551
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:34,038
is taking meetings with his ex,
get it all over town,

552
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,956
wait an hour,
then get me lunch with Andrew

553
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:39,668
on the books for this weekend,
some place Italian.

554
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,420
I really blew it, didn't I?

555
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:43,881
I mean, maybe you could
have been a better role model

556
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:46,884
when she was young, but also,
she never really had a chance.

557
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:49,011
This is what our celebrity
culture does to people.

558
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:52,806
So what you're saying is,
everything is society's fault,

559
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,516
and we as individuals never need

560
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,310
to take responsibility
for anything?

561
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:58,979
Uh, no. Not exactly.
I was just saying that...

562
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,565
Yeah. I like that.
I didn't do anything wrong

563
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:03,233
because I can't do
anything wrong

564
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,170
because we're all just products
of our environment,

565
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:06,320
bouncing around like marbles

566
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:07,847
in the game
of hungry hungry hippos

567
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,490
that is our random
and cruel universe.

568
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:11,343
Wait, no, that's not even
what I'm saying...

569
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,827
Yeah, it's not my fault.
It's society.

570
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,413
Everything is
because of society!

571
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,707
- Bojack, that...
- Dude, just let him have this.

572
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,126
Hooray!
Everything is meaningless!

573
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,879
Nothing I do has consequence!

574
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,384
So what'd you get,
anything good?

575
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,427
Oh, I got everything.

576
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:34,306
[Both laugh]

577
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:37,643
[Both chuckle]

578
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,979
J“ back in the '90s j”

579
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:44,566
j“ I was in a very famous TV show j“

580

00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,406
j“ bojack the horse j”

582
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:54,368
j“ don't act like you don't know I

584

00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:05,629
j“ I don't think I'm gonna last j“

586
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:06,964
j“ I guess I'll just try j”

587
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:09,133
j“ and make you understand I

589

j“ or I'm more man than a horse j“

590
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,519
j“ bojack j“

591
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,647
boxer versus raptor.
