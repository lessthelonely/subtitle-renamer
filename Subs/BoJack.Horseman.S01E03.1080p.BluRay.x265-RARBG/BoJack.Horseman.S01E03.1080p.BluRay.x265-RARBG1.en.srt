1
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:12,429
Who wants
chocolate chip pancakes?

2
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:14,014
I do! I do!

3
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,558
Ethan, didn't you already eat
your pancakes?

4
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:19,520
As Oliver north would say,
“I do not recall."

5
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:22,940
Hey, where's Sabrina?

6
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:26,026
Not hiding under the table,
that's for sure.

7
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:27,569
Aww...

8
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,614
Why don't you guys
leave this one to me?

9
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:32,866
Why aren't you dressed
for school, prickly muffin?

10
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,826
I'm scared. Olivia told me

11
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:37,246
sometimes, at school
they have pop quizzes.

12
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,414
I don't want to pop!

13
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:42,376
That's too much, man.

14
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:47,714
Sabrina,
nobody's popping on my watch.

15
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,050
You stick with me,
and I promise you,

16
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:52,427
everything's gonna be just fine.

17
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,806
- Cut, boom in the shot.
- What? I'll be in my trailer.

18
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,142
Nah, I'm just horsin' around.

19
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,355
You folks enjoying the show?

20
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:06,525
And how about Sara Lynn
as Sabrina? Isn't she wonderful?

21
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:09,570
Oh. Thank you.

22
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,030
Sarah Lynn.
You remember that name.

23
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,365
Back to one, everybody.

24
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:15,284
- Hey, you see those people?
- Yeah.

25
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,743
Well, those boobs and jerk wads

26
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,390
are the best friends
you'll ever have.

27
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,289
Without them, you're nothing.
Remember that.

28
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,624
Let's take it back
to "prickly muffin."

29
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,271
Your family will never
understand you,

30
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:26,461
your lovers will leave you
or try to change you,

31
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,255
but your fans,
you be good to them,

32
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:29,502
and they'll be good to you.

33
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,508
We are rolling. Sound speed.

34
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,969
The most important thing is,
you got to give the people

35
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:36,096
what they want,
even if it kills you,

36
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,974
even if it empties you out until
there's nothing left to empty.

37
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:41,351
No matter what happens,
no matter how much it hurts,

38
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,563
you don't stop dancing,
and you don't stop smiling,

39
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,232
and you give those people
what they want.

40
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:48,942
And action.

41
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,278
Why aren't you dressed
for school, prickly muffin?

42
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,700
You might remember her
as adorable Sabrina

43
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,870
from horsin'around,
but on her new dance pop album,

44
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:03,206
Sarah Lynn wants you to know
that she is hot to trot.

45
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:08,128
J“ why don't you touch
my prickly muffin? J“

46
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,506
j“ my prickly muffin j“

47
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,009
j“ ooh, prickly,
and it's muffin, and it's... j“

48
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,930
J“ it's ready
for your stuffing j“

49
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,683
what is the message
behind your music?

50
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,811
America needs to know that I'm
not that little girl anymore.

51
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,899
I'm a grown up, sophisticated
woman now, and I have sex,

52
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,484
and I do sexy things.

53
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,195
People like sex, okay,

54
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:36,198
and since I'm sexy right now,
they like me.

55
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:38,445
Are you at all worried
that audiences will grow bored

56
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,410
and abandon you
for the next sexy thing?

57
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,121
Are you kidding?
I'm Sarah freaking Lynn.

58
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,082
I'm gonna be sexy forever!

59
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,753
Pop star and child actress,
Sarah Lynn,

60
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,172
celebrates her 30th birthday
this month,

61
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,049
raising the question,
"does anyone care

62
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:57,469
about Sarah Lynn anymore?"
After all, she is 30.

63
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:59,221
Here to answer that question,

64
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:03,016
sexy, 14-year-old dubstep
wunderkind, sextina aquafina.

65
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,851
Hey!

66
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,561
Sextina, what's your take?

67
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,439
I love Sarah Lynn.
I grew up on her music, okay,

68
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,067
and she's, like, an inspiration,
but now, she is old,

69
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:14,504
and shriveled, and gross, and
nobody want her no more, okay?

70
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:17,072
They want sextina aquafina,
baby!

71
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,573
Ha ha! You're delightful.

72
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,118
So where does Sarah Lynn
go from here?

73
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,994
Oh, you know where
she should go?

74
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,746
She should go
wherever famous people go

75
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,153
when they're done being famous,

76
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,667
and nobody cares
if they live or die.

77
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,380
Who could that be?

78
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,521
Who-o-o wants
chocolate chip pancakes?

79
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,690
I do! I do!

80
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,233
Why are you talking to me?

81
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,640
I thought maybe if I said that,

82
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,403
you'd make me
chocolate chip pancakes.

83
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,990
Oh, come on, buddy.

84
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,576
It's a beautiful morning,
the sun is shining,

85
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,536
- birds are chirping...
- Hey, bojack,

86
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,765
- any plans for the weekend?
- Still hate the troops, boj?

87
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,224
Why don't you refill
your bird feeder, huh?

88
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,750
Yeah, who's a bird got to blow

89
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,770
- to get some seed around here?
- Good one.

90
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,754
Let's do something fun today.

91
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,840
- Like what?
- Like a cannonball!

92
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:04,554
Like a “buying you a new bed"?

93
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,099
Wow, everything in this store
is made

94
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,477
out of old train tracks
and a reclaimed pier.

95
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,104
Oh, great, for ten grand,
I can sleep like a hobo.

96
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,356
Do we need letter openers

97
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,441
made out of confederate
bayonets?

98
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,544
It says they're stained
with authentic yankee blood.

99
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:25,158
O-m-g. O-m-g!
O-m-m-f-c-s-d-v-r-q-q-p-q-f-g!

100
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,577
- I know.
- Ugh.

101
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,788
Yeah, it's me,
straight off your TV screens

102
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,373
and into your shitty lives.

103
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,042
It's Sarah Lynn
and Andrew Garfield.

104
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,503
Huh? What the...?

105
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,455
And what's your name, darling?

106
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,425
I... mm...

107
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,469
I'll just make it out
to "Evelyn."

108
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,431
Um, hi. Sarah Lynn, hi.

109
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:53,687
Bojack? Hey. Andrew,
this is bojack, my TV dad.

110
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,814
Oh, hello, I'm Andrew Garfield.

111
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:59,359
Andrew's my boyfriend.
We're a celebrity power couple.

112
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:00,777
It's no big deal.

113
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,654
It's a really big deal.

114
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:05,073
Sarah Lynn, I actually wanted
to talk to you about that.

115
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,284
When we started dating,
you were the biggest star

116
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,036
in the world,
but your last few albums tanked,

117
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,665
so now, I don't even know
what you are anymore.

118
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:17,460
Are you... are you breaking up
with me?

119
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,504
Oh, bother.

120
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,131
Um, are those candy pills,

121
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:23,049
'cause if so,
that is a lot of sugar.

122
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,759
Why are you doing this to me?

123
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,470
Do you like seeing me suffer?

124
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,765
Because you know
I'll bleed for you.

125
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,017
Ugh!

126
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,268
- Oh!
- Damn!

127
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,979
- Oh, dear.
- Whoa-oh-oh. Um...

128
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,266
Darling, please, I wanted
to do this in a public place

129
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,900
so you wouldn't make a scene.

130
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,069
You think I won't make
a scene, you limey bastard?

131
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,280
Then you really
don't know me at all.

132
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:48,617
Hey, everyone!
Who wants to see me take a dump

133
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,160
on that sofa?

134
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,955
And then she took a dump
on a sofa

135
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,433
made out of a reclaimed
propeller.

136
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,167
Where's Sarah Lynn now?

137
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,836
I checked her into promises.
28 days, she'll be good as new.

138
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,230
How did it feel
to check the girl

139
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,654
you raised on television
into rehab?

140
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:03,965
It was tough.

141
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,693
I would have liked
to reconnect with her.

142
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,904
At least we got to bond a little
on the drive to Malibu.

143
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,888
I can see my organs.

144
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:13,391
Oh, whoa! She is losing
a lot of blood, bojack.

145
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,310
Beautiful day for a drive,
though, huh?

146
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:16,895
Well, maybe the two of you

147
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,998
can catch up some more
when she gets out of rehab.

148
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,566
People don't usually want to
hang out with me after rehab.

149
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,027
I'm really more
of a before-rehab friend.

150
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:25,474
I think it's gonna be
a long time

151
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,770
before I see Sarah Lynn again.

152
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,450
Who could that be?

153
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,871
Look, bojack, I appreciate
what you were trying to do,

154
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,667
but I don't need rehab.
Look, good as new, huh?

155
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,252
Oh, great,
well, that's a relief.

156
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,254
Uh, should you be taking
all those pills?

157
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,881
It's dexitriathylphenolbarbatol.

158
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:48,093
- I got it from a doctor.
- Your doctor or just a doctor?

159
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,095
I don't know, some doctor, okay?

160
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,347
I met him at Adam levine's
Halloween party.

161
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,349
I think he said
his name was Dr. Who.

162
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:55,756
Yeah, I don't think that was...

163
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,561
Ohh, god damn.

164
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,106
Uh, are you supposed to be
snorting it like that?

165
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,233
Ugh! What are you, the paramedic

166
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,111
who restarted my heart at
Adam levine's Halloween party?

167
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,321
Okay, so before we
put to bed the whole

168
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,824
- ' you going to rehab thing...
- Bojack, all my life,

169
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,535
I've never been forced
to confront my problems head on.

170
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:18,248
No one has ever said "no" to me,
ever, so is it cool

171
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,375
if instead of confronting
my problems head on,

172
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,877
I just hide out here
for a little bit?

173
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,355
Sarah Lynn,
I hear what you're saying,

174
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,797
and I think I know
what you need.

175
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,091
You just need
a strong, responsible adult

176
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:31,970
to say, "yes.
Yes, you can move in with me."

177
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,972
This is gonna be fun.
Hey, everyone,

178
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,199
the old gang's getting
back together.

179
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,184
J“ three little orphans,
one, two, three. J“

180
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:42,647
who-o-o wants
chocolate chip pancakes?

181
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:43,940
I do! I do!

182
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,984
Uh, what's going on in here?

183
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,778
Morning, sleepy-pooh,
you want pancakes?

184
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,655
Yeah, that sounds great.

185
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,675
Ooh, tough break, champ.
I just gave the last one

186
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,868
to Sarah Lynn.
Early bird gets the worm.

187
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,495
More like early turd
gets the sperm.

188
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,915
Wha... "Early turd gets the sperm,"
nice one, Sarah Lynn.

189
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,709
You should do
a shouts and murmurs.

190
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,636
Help yourself
to some cold wheat bran, sport.

191
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,773
Thanks for letting me
crash here, bojack.

192
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,674
The guest room is yours
as long as you want.

193
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,342
You have a guest room?

194
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,095
Why have I been sleeping
on the couch for five years?

195
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,157
You'll get the guest room when
you've earned the guest room.

196
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,558
These pancakes are so good.

197
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,936
All Andrew ever wanted to eat
was stupid lasagne.

198
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,814
Andrew Garfield ioveslasagna?

199
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,221
I don't want to talk about him!

200
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,568
Bojack, can you drive me
to the mail today?

201
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,821
I really want to go shopping,
but I'm not allowed to drive

202
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,824
because somebody got a dui.

203
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,952
Uh, that somebody was you,
right?

204
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,704
I don't have to answer
your questions!

205
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:41,790
What are you,
the cop that pulled me over

206
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,875
after Adam levine's
Halloween party?

207
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:47,170
Honey, do you really think
going to the mall's a good idea?

208
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,177
I seem to recall another time
you went shopping

209
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:52,217
when things got
pretty out of control.

210
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:56,012
Oh, that's too much, man!

211
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,725
Really? Not the time
when she gored herself

212
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,894
with a bayonet
and shat on a floor model?

213
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,479
Hey, I'm not the crazy one.

214
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,397
Andrew's the one
who flies off the handle

215
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,192
whenever his agent sets up
an audition on a Monday.

216
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:13,696
Andrew Garfield hates mondays
andloveslasagna?

217
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,216
I said I don't want
to talk about it!

218
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,675
- She said drop it, Todd!
- Whatever,

219
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,284
I don't want to go
to the stupid mall.

220
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,971
I'll just tell my friends
to come here.

221
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,830
Muffin, I've got to work
on my book today,

222
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,748
and I can't have
a bunch of folks over

223
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:25,333
making a lot of noise.

224
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,586
Oh, I see. I'm a burden to you.

225
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,089
No, no, no, no, no.
Sweetheart. Sweetheart.

226
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:34,843
I'm no longer cute, so I have
nothing to offer this world.

227
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,470
Honey, of course your friends
are always welcome here.

228
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,514
Cool. Bye.

229
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,516
- Can I invite a frien...
- No.

230
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,311
You let that basket case
into your house?

231
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,022
That girl is a PR hurricane
that you don't need right now.

232
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,234
She has nowhere else to turn.
She broke up with her boyfriend.

233
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,695
She stabbed herself and
closed the wound with duct tape.

234
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,089
- She fired her agent.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

235
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,531
Back it up, horsey.

236
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,458
Did you say Sarah Lynn
doesn't have an agent?

237
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,535
Laura, hold my calls,
cancel everything!

238
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,262
Ahab's got a white whale
to catch, baby!

239
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,917
Uh, heho? Sthithere?

240
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,759
Oh, th... that's...
That's fragile.

241
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,279
Uh, no, oh, no, wait.

242
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:19,387
Careful. Careful. Careful.

243
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:21,264
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey!

244
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:24,058
Ah! Lemur!

245
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:40,241
Great party, Sarah Lynn.

246
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,369
Hi, what it is, banana bread?

247
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,330
I'm not looking
for a new agent right now.

248
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,541
Oh, whoa, whoa. Who says
I'm looking for a new client?

249
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,501
Slow your roll, speed racer.

250
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,796
We're just two single ladies
having a no-presh rap sesh.

251
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,424
I'm not one of those agents
who can't turn it off.

252
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:59,594
Your Ari emanuels and Vanessa
geckos and what have you.

253
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,804
Vanessa gecko is actually
Andrew's agent,

254
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,181
and she's really great.

255
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:06,434
Is she? I've heard that.

256
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,773
I didn't realize you were
so into house music.

257
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,900
Look, I asked her
to turn it down, but apparently,

258
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,861
this volume was prescribed
by Dr. Who

259
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:20,281
to treat something called
“uptight dickhead disease."

260
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,784
What do you... what do you think
about Sarah Lynn?

261
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:25,203
Oh, I don't really think
about her all that much.

262
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,622
I mean, obviously,
I'm a fan of her early work

263
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,207
which both satirized
and celebrated

264
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:30,959
youth culture's obsession
with sex,

265
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,086
but I do wonder
as a third-wave feminist

266
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,838
if it's even possible for women
to reclaim their sexuality

267
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,882
in this deeply entrenched
patriarchal society,

268
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,843
or if claiming to do so
is just a lie we tell ourselves

269
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,947
so we can more comfortably cater
to the male gaze.

270
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,639
- Uh, what?
- But you know,

271
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:47,392
on the other hand, I worry
that conversations like this one

272
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,638
often dismiss her as a mere
puppet of the industry...

273
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,497
- That's my same worry.
- Incapable of engaging

274
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,690
- in these discussions herself...
- Obviously.

275
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,067
And infantilization,
which is itself a product

276
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:57,544
- of the deeply misogynistic...
- So deep.

277
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,487
Society we live in.
But like I said,

278
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:01,414
I don't really think about her
all that much.

279
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,658
Okay, well,
that is very interesting,

280
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,118
but I was more asking,

281
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,012
like, what do you think
about her living here?

282
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,496
Oh, right.

283
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:11,124
Well, what was
your relationship like

284
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,001
with her when you were working
on the show?

285
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,919
It was very good,
very professional.

286
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:18,339
Bojack,
where did you go to college?

287
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,925
- Don't bother him, honey.
- Oh, it's no problem.

288
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:24,137
Honey, college is for
ugly people who can't tap dance.

289
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:27,432
- I want to be an architect.
- Sweetheart,

290
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,435
mommy didn't do what mommy did
to that star search producer

291
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,353
so that you could be
an architect.

292
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,855
- Aw.
- All right,

293
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,149
- take it sleazy, everybody.
- Wait, bojack,

294
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,776
um, what are you doing
this weekend?

295
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,303
I don't know.
I'll probably just go

296
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,839
to the amusement park,
maybe the circus,

297
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,823
fly a kite on the beach,
watch the sunset,

298
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,366
thenlwlhead back to my place

299
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,136
to watch any number
of Disney Princess movies

300
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,037
while eating ice cream
straight from the tub.

301
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,747
Whoa, that sounds like
so much fun.

302
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,290
Can I come?

303
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,792
Yeah,
like I want to spend my weekend

304
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,254
hanging out with a little girl.
Good one!

305
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,173
You should write
for the shouts and murmurs.

306
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,424
See you Monday!

307
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,071
So the makeup
they were putting on you

308
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,636
was not for the show,
it was just for the weekend?

309
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,096
Why does that matter?

310
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,890
I'm just trying
to understand the story.

311
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,076
Do you think it's possible
that you inviting Sarah Lynn

312
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,728
into your house now is your way
of compensating for not...

313
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,855
No, Diane,
I'm just helping out a friend.

314
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,566
I'm not trying to play out
some weird, sick dad fantasy,

315
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:21,235
or resolve a deep guilt
for past neglect,

316
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,946
or even try to retroactively fix
my own childhood

317
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,990
by recreating someone else's,

318
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:29,285
and I'm especially not doing
all those things at once!

319
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:30,536
Okay.

320
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,330
What happened?

321
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,499
Did somebody hurt
my precious baby?

322
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,043
Sarah Lynn! Ah! What the...?

323
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,795
Oh, hey, bojack.

324
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,731
I told my friends they could
tear this wall out to build

325
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:42,757
a sweet cocaine booth/sex
closet.

326
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:44,926
- Is that cool?
- No, that's not cool.

327
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:47,011
Oof. Way to harsh the vibe,
kissinger.

328
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:49,931
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize.

329
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:52,433
I thought this was a place
where Sarah Lynn

330
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,354
could finally be Sarah Lynn,
but I guess...

331
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,523
That's too much, man.

332
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,192
I always loved
that catch phrase.

333
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,799
Can your friends at least take
the artwork off the wall first?

334
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,782
Ooh. I want to say yes, but no.

335
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:10,910
- Okay, good talk.
- Wha... are you serious?

336
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,876
The reason I have called
this house meeting is...

337
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,878
Todd, how many times
have we been over this?

338
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,381
You don't have the authority
to call house meetings.

339
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:27,093
Only I can call a house meeting.
You can propose a house meeting.

340
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,238
All right, fine, fine, fine,
but the reason I propose

341
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,823
- this house meeting...
- Your proposal has been

342
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,932
submitted and
is under board review.

343
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,393
- Proposal denied.
- Bojack, this Sarah Lynn thing

344
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,813
is getting out of control, okay?
She's taking advantage of you.

345
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,524
What? No she's not.
We have a special relationship.

346
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,276
You couldn't possibly
understand.

347
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,528
Oh, my god. Look at what
she's done to your house.

348
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,756
All right, look, I mean,
I stepped on a needle earlier.

349
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,198
I think I'm addicted
to heroin now,

350
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,659
so now, that's probably
gonna be a whole thing.

351
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:53,578
I have to say,
I agree with Todd.

352
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,347
You're not this girl's father,
and you're not doing her

353
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,457
any favors by refusing
to set boundaries.

354
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,834
Look, I played a dad
for nine years on TV,

355
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,979
so I think I know a little bit
more about parenting

356
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:04,005
than you two jokers.
The kids on horsin'around

357
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:05,631
didn't need boundaries.

358
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,092
All they needed was
some good, old-fashioned love.

359
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,678
Bojack!
This is not a TV show, okay?

360
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,597
This is real life.

361
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,892
Ah! Lemur on fire!
Lemur on fire!

362
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,814
Some good, old-fashioned love,
and I'm gonna give it to her.

363
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,942
I'm gonna give it to her
so... hard.

364
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:28,529
You know, I feel like
we don't ever hang out.

365
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,492
Here you are, milady,

366
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,620
a gin and nutmeg
just like you asked.

367
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,580
Ugh. Too much nutmeg.

368
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,874
Well, you know what
would taste even better?

369
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,460
An endorsement
for a Slovakian yogurt.

370
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,587
Could Vanessa gecko
get you that?

371
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:48,549
Vanessa gecko got Andrew
the social network,

372
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,010
and she has skybox seats
at the staples center.

373
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,821
- What do you have?
- Well, I've got a table

374
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,531
at the comedy central roast
of Gloria Stein...

375
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,595
Hey, Sarah Lynn, what say
we spend the day together,

376
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,101
just you and me,
away from all the haters?

377
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,522
- I want to say yes, but...
- Great, let's go.

378
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,775
J“ it really seems like
some things are forever I

379
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,693
j“ in this world I

380
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,029
j“ don't you know
I'm feeling fine j”

381
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,657
j“ together with my girl j“

382
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:17,787
.i' daddy's girl
she's daddy's girl j“

383
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,207
you know, Sarah Lynn,
I got a feeling

384
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:24,794
- everything's gonna be okay.
- Uh-huh.

385
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,672
Hey, did you hear
kazaz got cancer?

386
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,590
What? Herb kazaz has cancer?

387
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,927
Yeah, in the butt. He's got,
like, six months I think.

388
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:35,304
Well, that's horrible.
Why would you tell me that now?

389
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,848
I don't know. The sun setting
over those two hills

390
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,868
made me think of a big ass,
and that made me think

391
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,477
of ass cancer,
and that made me think

392
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:44,730
of herb kazaz's ass cancer.
You really didn't know?

393
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,524
No, herb and I aren't
on the best...

394
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,776
Look, I'm trying to have
a moment here. I can't...

395
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,153
Hey, I want to give you
something.

396
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,030
Is this your TV guide award?

397
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,616
It's the most prestigious
award I ever won.

398
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,469
I always thought if I ever
had kids of my own,

399
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,121
I'd give it to them one day.
I want you to have it.

400
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:03,374
Oh, wow. Bojack, thanks.
You're sweet.

401
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:07,128
J“ na-na-na-na la-ia-ia-ia j'

402
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:08,921
j“ na-na-na-na la-ia-ia-ia j“

403
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,506
- what are you doing?
- Shh.

404
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,234
Just let the credits roll,
let the credits roll.

405
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,969
J“ sha-na-na-na-na-na
special moment j“

406
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,680
j“ exec producer garry Marshall I

407
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,599
j“ na-na-na such a happy day j“

408
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,267
“sit, ubu, sit."
“Good dog." "Arf."

409
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,894
- Can we go home now?
- Yeah, okay, we're done.

410
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:28,566
J“ hey now, boy, come and try
my clitoris is ginormous j“

411
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,739
- Hello?
- Bojack horseman.

412
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,741
Did you get rid
of your old TV guide award?

413
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,587
This pawnshop on la cienega
was selling one

414
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:39,952
- with your name on it.
- What?

415
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,954
Wait, why were you
at a pawnshop?

416
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,681
Oh, I just have a guy there
who calls me

417
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,750
whenever TV awards come in
so I can buy 'em.

418
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,710
I put my name on,
it's like I won it myself!

419
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,337
I have two golden globes

420
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,547
and a people's choice
for temple grandin.

421
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,215
Sarah Lynn!

422
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,676
Hello? You still there?

423
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,471
J“ my clitoris is ginor... j“

424
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,014
Okay, party's over.
Everybody out.

425
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:01,641
- Aw!
- Not you.

426
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,352
You are in big trouble,
young lady.

427
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,437
I can't believe
you pawned my award.

428
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:09,357
It wasn't personal. I just
thought your award was stupid,

429
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,192
and I already have
a billion other awards,

430
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,985
and I wanted to get money
for drugs.

431
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,072
Look, things have been tough
for you, and I understand that.

432
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,918
I know what you're
going through right now.

433
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,951
Oh, you know
what I'm going through? Why?

434
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,746
Because you were on some dumb
kids show a million years ago?

435
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,956
- Hey, now.
- I had my own fashion line

436
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:29,418
when I was ten.
By 20, I was packing stadiums.

437
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,380
I get letters every day
from boys telling me

438
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,799
that I was the first girl
they masturbated to.

439
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,760
Literally, someone
tells me that every day.

440
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,721
- That is gross.
- Oh-ho, I know!

441
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,932
You sit up here
in your little house

442
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:46,060
and feel sorry for yourself?
Oh, guess what, Bo-j,

443
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,288
in order to be a has-been,
you have to have actually,

444
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,940
- you know, been.
- You are way out of line!

445
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,317
You're not my dad.
You're just a rugged, older man

446
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:55,486
who provided me with a strong,
masculine presence

447
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,071
during my formative years.

448
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:58,989
I'm not your dad,
and you're not my child.

449
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,659
We're just a man and a lady
living in a house together,

450
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:04,203
and we're both adults,
and we're both a little drunk.

451
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,295
Who-o-o lit my ottoman on fire?

452
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,298
Seriously,
you seriously don't know?

453
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,926
I'm a bad "widdle" girl.

454
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,178
Yeah, you are bad, very bad!

455
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:25,433
You want me to put it out
with my boob?

456
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,268
- Uh, what?
- Your boob

457
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:31,397
is a very impractical way
to put out a fire.

458
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:32,773
What is happening?

459
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,900
I think you have
a serious drug problem.

460
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,195
The only drug I need is horse.

461
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,822
Guys, guys, what are you doing?

462
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,299
Please don't do this.

463
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,409
No, no. Why are you...

464
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,286
This is a very bad idea.

465
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,139
Can I at least get my blanket...

466
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,683
Let me get my blanket
out from under...

467
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,291
Oh g... oh my god, my arm.

468
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,959
- You got my arm.
- Ow! Ow!

469
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:54,378
I'm in it now.
Oh, god, no! I'm a part of it.

470
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:01,135
I still haven't regained
the feeling in my fingers.

471
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:03,137
That was the longest two minutes
of my life.

472
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:05,848
Um, I think it was a little
longer than two minutes.

473
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,433
It was longer than two minutes.

474
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,519
How do you not get
that this is terrible?

475
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,229
Oh, you mean
from a PR. Standpoint?

476
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:15,149
Yeah, 'cause if this got out,
oh, I would get flayed!

477
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:18,360
Oh, I'm done being
the voice of reason.

478
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:22,072
It's exhausting.
I got to take an angry nap.

479
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,492
Ugh.ugh.ugh.

480
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,952
I know. I know.
She's taking advantage of me.

481
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,847
Actually, it kind of feels
like you're the one

482
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,414
taking advantage of her.
She's the one

483
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:32,917
with substance abuse problems
and daddy issues.

484
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,723
Hey, we both have
substance abuse problems

485
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,879
- and daddy issues.
- Yeah, but she came to you

486
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,965
for help.

487
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,945
Hey, notice how
I've been ignoring you,

488
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,387
playing hard to get?
Only makes you want me more.

489
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,240
Ugh. Go stand
on the other side of the room.

490
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,099
- Okay.
- Sarah Lynn, get your coat.

491
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,310
- I'm taking you to rehab.
- Nah,

492
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,597
I was gonna keep hanging out
here if that's all right.

493
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,731
- No, it's not all right.
- What?

494
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:57,566
This place isn't good for you.

495
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,444
You need to go where you can
get help, real help.

496
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:02,696
But I thought you were always
gonna be there for me

497
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:03,948
like you said.

498
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,659
I will always be there for you.

499
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,369
Cut, let's take ten.

500
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:11,288
That's ten, everyone.
Let's make it a tight ten.

501
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:12,682
These pages are shit.

502
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,124
You understand? Shit.

503
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,851
I wouldn't wipe my ass
with these pages.

504
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,687
It would defeat the whole
purpose of wiping my ass.

505
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,380
- Phone for you.
- Uh-huh.

506
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:21,006
You get me points
on the back end?

507
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,508
Well, I told you

508
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:23,902
I'm not gonna do it
unless I get points.

509
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,344
Oh, they can't find any?

510
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:26,780
Well, maybe they could
suck some out of my dick!

511
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:28,013
I'm on the phone.

512
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,975
You're being very rude.

513
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,185
You promised me you would
always be there.

514
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,604
Sarah Lynn,
this is for your own good.

515
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,273
You can't stay here anymore.

516
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,400
Okie-doke.
I guess I'll just move out

517
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:40,887
and find
one of the billion people

518
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:42,695
who will let me party
at their house.

519
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,531
Uh, well,
you should not do that.

520
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:48,242
Oh, I know. I know,
but I can, so I will.

521
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:50,160
I'm at a place right now
where I never need

522
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:53,080
to grow as a person
or rise to an occasion

523
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,666
because I can constantly
just surround myself

524
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:58,252
with sycophants and enablers
until I die tragically young.

525
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:00,045
- Wh-what?
- Yeah,

526
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:03,215
it's pretty much
too late for me.

527
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,135
Well, them's the breaks.
Take it sleazy, everybody.

528
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:08,888
Oh, by the way,
I called Vanessa gecko,

529
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,556
and I'm meeting with her
tomorrow.

530
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,267
- Thanks for the suggestion.
- No! No, no, no, no, no!

531
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:16,478
Hey, you guys want to hear
my new catchphrase?

532
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:20,274
Suck a dick, dumb shits!

533
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:25,154
Laura, the dummy took the bait.
Now for phase two.

534
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:28,949
Is she gone?
Is it safe to come out?

535
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,035
Leak to the trades
that Andrew Garfield's agent

536
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:34,038
is taking meetings with his ex,
get it all over town,

537
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,956
wait an hour,
then get me lunch with Andrew

538
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:39,668
on the books for this weekend,
some place Italian.

539
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,420
I really blew it, didn't I?

540
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:43,881
I mean, maybe you could
have been a better role model

541
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:46,884
when she was young, but also,
she never really had a chance.

542
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:49,011
This is what our celebrity
culture does to people.

543
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:52,806
So what you're saying is,
everything is society's fault,

544
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,516
and we as individuals never need

545
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,310
to take responsibility
for anything?

546
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:58,979
Uh, no. Not exactly.
I was just saying that...

547
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,565
Yeah. I like that.
I didn't do anything wrong

548
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:03,233
because I can't do
anything wrong

549
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,170
because we're all just products
of our environment,

550
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:06,320
bouncing around like marbles

551
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:07,847
in the game
of hungry hungry hippos

552
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,490
that is our random
and cruel universe.

553
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:11,343
Wait, no, that's not even
what I'm saying...

554
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,827
Yeah, it's not my fault.
It's society.

555
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,413
Everything is
because of society!

556
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,707
- Bojack, that...
- Dude, just let him have this.

557
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,126
Hooray!
Everything is meaningless!

558
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,879
Nothing I do has consequence!

559
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,384
So what'd you get,
anything good?

560
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,427
Oh, I got everything.

561
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,979
J“ back in the '90s j”

562
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:44,566
j“ I was in a very famous TV show j“

563
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,988
- j“ I'm bojack the horse j“
- I bojack j“

564
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,406
j“ bojack the horse j”

565
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:54,368
j“ don't act like you don't know I

566
00:24:56,537 --> 00:25:00,624
j“ and I'm trying to hold on to my past j“

567
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:02,126
j“ it's been so long j“

568
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:05,629
j“ I don't think I'm gonna last j“

569
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:06,964
j“ I guess I'll just try j”

570
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:09,133
j“ and make you understand I

571
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:13,512
j“ that I'm more horse than a man j'

572
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,392
j“ or I'm more man than a horse j“

573
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,519
j“ bojack j“

574
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,647
boxer versus raptor.
