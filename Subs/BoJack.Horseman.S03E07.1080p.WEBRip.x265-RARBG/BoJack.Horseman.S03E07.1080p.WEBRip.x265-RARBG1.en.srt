1
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:34,243
Guys, I think we could use
another phone jack over here.

2
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:38,121
Cabracadabra.
We wanna reach out and grab you.

3
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,749
-No, we're a cab company.
-Can you toss me the thing?

4
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,795
- Sorry. The other thing.
- Okay. Watch the couch.

5
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:47,923
Hey. Goddammit!

6
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,841
I apologize for... I understand.

7
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:51,802
Mind if I put you on hold one second?

8
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,845
Don't put me on hold.
Do you know who I am?

9
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:56,473
I just won a Baby's Choice Award,
the winner of which

10
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,685
has gone to take home the Oscar
seven of the last 15 years.

11
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,187
So, yeah, <i>that </i>BoJack Horseman.

12
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:04,856
Otherwise known as the guy you keep
sending your dumb newspaper to

13
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,525
even though I never subscribed to it.

14
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,068
I'm putting you on hold.

15
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,078
-We have a situation, sir.
-Talk to me.

16
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,789
Guy's name is BoJack Horseman.
He's pretty steamed.

17
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:24,126
I've tried everything, but we might need
to bring the Closer in on this one.

18
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:27,504
Calm down. We can sort this out
without having to get the Closer involved.

19
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,299
Did you offer 26 weeks
at 50 percent off the newsstand price?

20
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:33,635
I went through the entire checklist, sir.
Even offered him a free tote bag.

21
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:37,055
What kind of monster says no
to a tote bag? Good work, rep.

22
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:40,559
You've done all that could be
expected of you. I'll take it from here.

23
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,689
Yeah, Got it. Right.
I understand. I'll take it from here.

24
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:47,649
God help us...

25
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:51,194
Is what I'd say if we needed God's help.
Fortunately, we got one better.

26
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:54,031
Morning. Good morning.
How was your weekend? How are you?

27
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,658
Good work yesterday.
Get out of my way, please.

28
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:02,914
We have a situation on line two.
Name's Horseman. BoJack Horseman.

29
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:04,625
Thank you. I'll take it from here.

30
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:10,005
Hello, good morning, and I say this
with 100 percent sincerity...

31
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,549
<i>How can I help you?</i>

32
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:21,016
<i>♪♪</i>

33
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:10,649
I never subscribed to the <i>L.A. Gazette.</i>
I do not read the <i>L.A. Gazette.</i>

34
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:14,111
I have called this number so many times
to stop sending it to me.

35
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,531
Yet every morning, I open my door
on a new edition of the <i>L.A. Gazette.</i>

36
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,075
It's like I'm in a boring episode
of <i>The Twilight Zone.</i>

37
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,369
Sir, we are going to unravel this mystery.

38
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:26,373
But before we dig in,
is there anything I can get you?

39
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,333
A glass of ice water perhaps?

40
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:30,836
Yeah, sure, I'd love a glass of ice water.

41
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:35,257
Fabulous. Johnny will get that to you
in three, two, one...

42
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,760
Uh... huh.

43
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:42,139
I see you've been receiving
our paper for six months,

44
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,184
but there's no record of you
ever registering a complaint.

45
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:48,687
From whence the hostility, counselor?

46
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,773
It wasn't a problem until recently,
because up until a week ago

47
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:55,193
the boy who lives with me used the paper
to make a giant paper-mâché Todd head.

48
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:57,738
-What was that?
-I live with my best friend, Todd.

49
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,157
Good kid, but sometimes
he gets ideas to do things.

50
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:07,247
-Pretty scary, right?
-Yes. What the hell is that?

51
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,749
Giant Todd Head, of course.

52
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,126
I've been working on him
for the last six months.

53
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,169
What? Why?

54
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,213
It all started
when a rustling from the kitchen

55
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:17,799
jostled me from tender slumber.

56
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,262
Uh...

57
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,391
What was that?

58
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,399
If there's a ghost present,
please do not scream

59
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:39,070
or have a skull face or be wearing
a tattered white satin gown.

60
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:46,912
Someone or something is stealing our food.

61
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:50,999
I made a giant papier-mâché Todd head
to scare it away. Think it'll work?

62
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:54,002
If I made a giant papier-mâché me head,
would you stop eating my food?

63
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,671
You should take this seriously.
We might have an infestation.

64
00:04:56,755 --> 00:05:00,634
We do have an infestation, of Todds.
Look at that, they're getting bigger.

65
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:04,805
And? Did the head help to ameliorate
your pest peccadillo?

66
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:08,475
No. Todd abandoned the project as soon
as he started working on Cabracadabra.

67
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,644
<i>-What's Cabracadabra?</i>
-That's what I said.

68
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,063
-What's Cabracadabra?
-That's what I said.

69
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,274
-What's Cabracadabra?
-That's what we want you to say.

70
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,736
If I didn't know any better,
you were about to pitch an idea.

71
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:24,407
-We <i>are </i>about to pitch you an idea.
-I did not know better.

72
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,994
Has this ever happened to you?
Hey, where you headed?

73
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:30,956
Oh, yes. That happens to me all the time.

74
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,917
-We're not at the main part yet.
-I'm so sorry. Please continue.

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,253
-To the opera, good sir.
-Okay.

76
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,047
Am I watching to see if the whole thing
has happened to me?

77
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,633
-Or looking for one specific thing?
-Kind of both.

78
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:46,471
So I just keep watching until I see
something that has happened to me?

79
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,014
-Yes.
-What if we get to the end,

80
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,808
none of it has ever happened to me?

81
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,477
Maybe just try to put yourself
in Emily's shoes right now.

82
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,563
Got it. Sorry for the interruption.
Please continue.

83
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,274
-So, is this where you live?
-Yes, it is.

84
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:01,903
-Alone or are you in a relationship?
-This hardly seems appropriate.

85
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,990
Driver, you're starting
to make me feel uncomfortable.

86
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,575
Yeah, Todd. What are you doing?

87
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,496
Has a creepy driver
ever given you his number

88
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,083
or told you that you reminded him
of his dead girlfriend?

89
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,837
Or repeated your address slowly,
like he was trying to memorize it?

90
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,923
-No, never.
-Unfortunately, if you are a woman

91
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:25,760
all those things
would happen to you every day.

92
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:28,346
That's right, Todd.
According to my own research,

93
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,142
nine out of ten men
are total dirtbag creeps, just the worst.

94
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,395
But what if there was a ride-share service
that could guarantee

95
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:40,025
no creepy men drivers
because there are no men drivers at all?

96
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,693
What are you saying, robot drivers?

97
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:45,155
What if they become sentient
and try to murder us, or unionize?

98
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,615
That could be a real headache.

99
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:49,951
No, not murderous robots. Women.

100
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,287
Todd, you have done it again.

101
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,956
Actually, Emily and I
came up with it together.

102
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,835
Todd and Emily,
you've done it again for the first time.

103
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,339
And that's why we're setting up shop
at your house.

104
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,007
Why does it have to be my house?

105
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,176
There's no room
at Mr. Peanutbutter's house.

106
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,178
It's full of spaghetti strainers.

107
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,096
-Why?
-Who can recall?

108
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,724
I figure the longer they're there,
the bigger the payoff.

109
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,060
And they've been sitting there
for months now.

110
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:19,064
So you can bet
the payoff's going to be pretty huge.

111
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:22,859
<i>So, why did you let them use your house?</i>

112
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,611
Hey, Todd, where do you want this...?

113
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,029
Uh...

114
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,739
<i>- I felt guilty.</i>
<i>- About what?</i>

115
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:31,201
<i>Todd had this old girlfriend.</i>
<i>I met her a couple weeks back.</i>

116
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,745
-Hey.
-Hey.

117
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:41,086
-What are you still doing up?
-I got thirsty.

118
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,254
Then you came to the right place.

119
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,508
Should we call Todd,
see if he wants to join us?

120
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,469
I'm tired of trying to figure out
what Todd wants.

121
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,554
And what do you want?

122
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,349
-I'll start with a whiskey.
-My kind of girl.

123
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,685
-So then we had sex.
-What? Why?

124
00:07:56,768 --> 00:08:00,021
I was lonely? She was there?
Why does anyone have sex with anyone?

125
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:04,818
<i>Intimacy, affection, a deep need</i>
<i>to connect to the world at large.</i>

126
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:08,488
The same reasons three million people
subscribe to the <i>L.A. Gazette.</i>

127
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,490
-What?
<i>-I'm getting ahead of myself.</i>

128
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,409
<i>Please, continue your story.</i>

129
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,786
-You should go.
-Yeah.

130
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,037
That was a mistake.

131
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:19,416
Agreed. A wonderful, sexy mistake
for you and a regular mistake for me.

132
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,835
No, it was a regular mistake for me, too.

133
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,921
-What are we gonna tell Todd?
-Nothing, obviously.

134
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,257
-I don't want to hurt him.
-Neither do I.

135
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,301
-That's why we won't tell him.
-I feel like we should tell him.

136
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,846
That feeling is you selfishly
trying to assuage your guilt.

137
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,724
If you cared about Todd,
you would keep this a secret forever.

138
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:36,975
I'm not good at lying.

139
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:41,146
Ask me if when I was a little girl,
did I ever used to put a stuffed animal

140
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,231
in my underpants
and rock back and forth on it.

141
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,900
When you were a little girl,
did you ever do that thing you said?

142
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,486
What? Get-- No!

143
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,240
I think it's gonna be fine.
Why would it even come up?

144
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,367
Not like there's any reason
the three of us

145
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,327
would ever be in a room together again.

146
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,288
BoJack, you remember Emily, right?

147
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,249
-I've never seen you before in my life.
-No.

148
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:04,085
-You don't remember BoJack?
-Oh, yeah. BoJack.

149
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:07,338
What... why... What are you here?
Why are you doing at Todd's house?

150
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:08,923
Todd's house? This is my house.

151
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:12,594
It's cool if we set up shop here, right?
That's not gonna be weird?

152
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,220
What? Why would that be weird?

153
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,222
-What are you implying?
-Nothing.

154
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:19,309
It's not weird for me either,
if we're keeping track of weirdnesses.

155
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:23,688
-Okay, what is going on here?
-Why would you? I don't even--

156
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,982
-Literally nothing going on.
-No, something's going on.

157
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,650
I've got a nose for news.

158
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,528
In this case, Nu is the Greek letter
representing the variable

159
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:31,946
for "What Is Going On?"

160
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,240
So let's solve for Nu, shall we?

161
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:39,079
I think someone's not saying something
to someone else about something.

162
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:42,457
-That's crazy.
-I know what it is.

163
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,334
Cabracadabra's going to be huge.

164
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,462
No one wants to say it out loud
because we're afraid we'll jinx it.

165
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,006
Yeah. That is exactly what it is.

166
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,675
Yes. Your stupid business
is gonna be very successful.

167
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,260
-Yes.
-Glad that's out in the open.

168
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,888
We all know what everyone was thinking,
we don't need to ask

169
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,099
any more questions
or do any wondering about mysteries.

170
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,016
Nope.

171
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,228
If you'll excuse me,
I need to go watch a sport.

172
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,479
Great idea.

173
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,649
The worst part is things have actually
been going really well with Todd.

174
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,734
Our friendship is in a really good place.

175
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:10,777
Last week he said,

176
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,613
"Did you know the wiener dog
is neither a wiener nor a dog?"

177
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,574
Instead of saying,
"Shut up, Todd," I said, "Okay."

178
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,827
<i>So, why did you</i>
<i>sleep with Emily?</i>

179
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,747
<i>Do you think that part of you was getting</i>
<i>uncomfortable with that closeness?</i>

180
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,500
<i>You felt like you didn't deserve</i>
<i>Todd's friendship</i>

181
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:29,546
<i>and you wanted to somehow</i>
<i>externalize that feeling into action?</i>

182
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,174
No, man, I think I'm just a dumb asshole.
Can't it just be that?

183
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,717
When you do bad things,

184
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:38,471
you have something you can point to
when people eventually leave you.

185
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:42,308
It's not you, you tell yourself,
it's that bad thing you did.

186
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,727
<i>Do you often keep people at arm's length?</i>

187
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:48,523
<i>Are you afraid of being known</i>
<i>and knowing others?</i>

188
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,484
Yeah, you know, I think that you're
definitely hitting on something real

189
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,570
that I would love to drill down into,

190
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,030
but I gotta go
to this marketing meeting now.

191
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:59,200
Which is so annoying
because I totally want to keep talking

192
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,952
about that thing you're talking about.

193
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,537
But marketing meetings, right?

194
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,290
I mean, they're so important.
Can I call you back tomorrow?

195
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,208
<i>-Of course.</i>
-Great. Bye.

196
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,255
<i>-So, how was your marketing meeting?</i>
-Weird.

197
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,466
-Sorry I'm late.
-It's fine. We're just getting started.

198
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,093
I had the worst morning.

199
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,845
Hanging on every word. Don't tell us.

200
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,263
So I drove here, right?

201
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:24,350
<i>I'm sitting at the entrance to the garage</i>
<i>when I realize I don't have my key card.</i>

202
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,519
<i>I gotta drive all the way home to get it.</i>

203
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:29,272
<i>When I got there,</i>
<i>I couldn't find it anywhere.</i>

204
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,525
<i>Suddenly, I remember:</i>
<i>I put it in the glove compartment.</i>

205
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,652
<i>It was in my car the entire time.</i>

206
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:35,904
Okay.

207
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:39,198
Because I was driving back and forth
so much, I ran out of gas.

208
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:40,742
I pulled into a 76.

209
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,870
I was about to pump the gas,
I realized I didn't have my credit card,

210
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,122
when I remembered
it was on my desk at home

211
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,708
because I used it to contribute to
my friend's dumb Kickstarter campaign.

212
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,626
Diane...

213
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,337
Have you donated
to Virginia's dumb Kickstarter yet?

214
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,340
-Oh, shit.
-Throw her 50 bucks. You can afford it.

215
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:58,051
Yeah, but I don't like feeling
like I have to, Roxy.

216
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,386
Does the world need
a stop-motion short film

217
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,263
about a pig who goes to circus school?

218
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:05,141
Think of it like you're doing
a nice thing for your friend.

219
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,643
Mmm... okay.

220
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,562
<i>I called a cab to take me home</i>
<i>to get my credit card.</i>

221
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:13,066
Then back to the gas station, get my car,
fill it up and come here.

222
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,193
So that's why I'm late.

223
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,154
-Why did you tell us that whole story?
-I don't know.

224
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:22,325
-Why did you tell me that whole story?
-I don't know.

225
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:27,038
Anyway, I had the ad agency whip up
some options for the new <i>Secretariat </i>ads.

226
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:30,041
Good news is the movie
is killing out there. Everyone loves it.

227
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,669
If everyone loves it,
why do we need a new ad campaign?

228
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,046
These are
the "For Your Consideration" ads.

229
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,841
They're a reminder to the Academy,
"Have you considered this yet?"

230
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,427
The Academy doesn't always
consider everything.

231
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,972
So they need constant
consideration reminders.

232
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,182
-That's very considerate.
-This one tested the best.

233
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,434
That's a good one.
The rest of these suck.

234
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,812
Dumb. Dumb. Stupid. Offensive.

235
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,939
Ugly. Boring. Typical. Stupid.

236
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,608
Bad. Hideous. Disgusting. Gross. Cliché.

237
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,694
-I am really good at this.
-Huh.

238
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,823
-I kind of like this one.
-How'd that piece of crap get in there?

239
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,074
We ruled that one out.

240
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,575
It's actually really powerful.

241
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:07,537
<i>What spoke to you</i>
<i>about </i>that <i>particular ad?</i>

242
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,913
<i>I don't know.</i>

243
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:11,582
<i>All the pictures of me,</i>
<i>they looked backwards.</i>

244
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:15,211
<i>When I looked at the mirror ad,</i>
<i>I was seeing me as I see myself</i>

245
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,797
<i>and I thought</i>
<i>there was something beautiful about that.</i>

246
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,382
<i>Intimate, almost.</i>

247
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,634
Of course you like this ad.
When you look at it

248
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,678
you see Secretariat, I see an old turtle.

249
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:27,098
"Hello, old turtle. Are you Secretariat?
No? You're just some old turtle?

250
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:30,935
-What the hell? You've aged terribly."
-But you've got the heart of a champion.

251
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,396
I got a team of cardiologists at Cedars
who say different.

252
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,190
Isn't that the point of the movie,
that anybody could be Secretariat?

253
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:39,527
The point of the movie is to make
a lot of money and win awards.

254
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,779
If anyone who looks at this ad
is Secretariat,

255
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,406
why should you win the Oscar?

256
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:47,869
He's right, BoJack. Why don't you
leave this to the experts, okay?

257
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:53,082
Yes. You're a star.

258
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,252
<i>So, you also had sex with your publicist?</i>

259
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,921
<i>Yeah, couple times.</i>
<i>We have a very complicated relationship.</i>

260
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,214
It's complicated.

261
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:04,093
If our relationship was a Meryl Streep
movie, it would be <i>Doubt.</i>

262
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,888
Don't forget, you have <i>Ellen</i> tomorrow.

263
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,514
Don't wear that sweater I hate.

264
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:11,350
Yes. You're in charge.

265
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,979
Okay, you know, I gotta say
I don't feel like I'm in charge.

266
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,648
If you're gonna throw a tantrum,
forget the whole thing.

267
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,610
I'm not throwing a tantrum-- Why are we
having sex in my car?

268
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,196
-Can we at least go back to your place?
-No, BoJack.

269
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,864
I don't know where you live.

270
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,992
You control every part of my life,
I don't know anything about you.

271
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,621
-You don't want to know me, BoJack.
-No, I do.

272
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,457
-I want to be known and know others.
-You don't.

273
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:40,004
I know you and I know what you want.
This is exactly what you want.

274
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,465
<i>What do you think she meant by that?</i>

275
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,259
Better question:
Why am I still getting the <i>L.A. Gazette?</i>

276
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:50,431
Do you think getting the paper every day
is a reminder of Todd's papier-mâché head?

277
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:54,352
<i>The project he abandoned</i>
<i>to make time for the old girlfriend</i>

278
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,562
<i>you spent an intimate night with?</i>

279
00:14:56,646 --> 00:15:00,066
Could that be why you want
to cancel your subscription?

280
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:03,528
No. I want to cancel my subscription
because newspapers are dumb.

281
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,446
I feel I'm very clear on this point.

282
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,740
Every morning,
someone knocks on my door and says,

283
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,367
"Throw away this garbage for me."

284
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,453
So you don't feel any guilt
about your tryst with Emily?

285
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:15,289
Well, I have had trouble sleeping.

286
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,459
- You're silly.
- No, you're silly.

287
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:19,460
Oh, God.

288
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:22,380
-Okay, your turn, truth or dare.
-Truth.

289
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:27,093
What is the worst recent thing you did
to someone who cared about you?

290
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,805
-The worst thing? Or the most recent?
-Both.

291
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,641
Can you keep it down, please?
Some people are trying to sleep.

292
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,852
-We are keeping it down.
-We've been really quiet.

293
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,395
-You're basically shouting.
-Sorry.

294
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:41,858
-Do you want me to whisper? Like this?
-Yeah, we can be real whispery.

295
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,068
No, because then I'll hear the
"psst, psst, psst."

296
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:46,779
And I'll be up all night
wondering what you're talking about.

297
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:49,615
-Uh, what would we be talking about?
-Yeah, BoJack.

298
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,659
What would we be talking about?

299
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,327
I don't know. Dumb stuff.

300
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:56,205
Forget it. Can't sleep here.
I'm gonna go sleep in my boat.

301
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,181
Freeze, candy ass.

302
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:15,766
-Character Actress Margo Mart--?
-I said, "Freeze."

303
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,145
<i>Hold on. Are you telling me</i>
<i>esteemed character actress</i>

304
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:23,983
<i>and fugitive from the law Margo Martindale</i>
<i>has been living in your boat?</i>

305
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:27,236
Is this one of those situations where
everything we discuss is confidential,

306
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,155
due to customer
service rep-client privilege?

307
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,531
Of course.

308
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,700
Then yes,
Margo Martindale is living in my boat.

309
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:37,705
-How long have you been in here?
-Well, after the incident in Yorba Linda.

310
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,338
Eh...

311
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,881
Well, Margo, old gal,

312
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,258
looks like you've bought yourself
another day of freedom.

313
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,177
But at what cost?

314
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,430
I knew I had to lay low.
Go off the grid, disappear.

315
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,182
I know what "lay low" means.

316
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,310
<i>So, I disappeared for a little bit.</i>

317
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,104
Mm-hmm.

318
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:05,691
<i>Somewhere I knew I had no chance</i>
<i>of being discovered--</i>

319
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,985
<i>regional theater.</i>

320
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:12,573
<i>I did a run at the La Jolla Playhouse</i>
<i>in an obscure Tennessee Williams play.</i>

321
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,742
I have ambition, sir.

322
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:18,871
Dreams that don't incorporate
the concerns of cynics like you.

323
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:22,291
Cynic.
Always laughing that terrible laugh.

324
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,585
-Ramona...
-Well, go ahead and laugh.

325
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:27,296
Laugh your life away. I can laugh, too.

326
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,133
Ramona, I'm telling you...

327
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,856
She's dead.

328
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,028
<i>I was good. Too good.</i>

329
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:54,448
<i>The </i>San Diego Union-Tribune
<i>called me, "A talent to watch."</i>

330
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:56,367
<i>I knew I had to get out of there.</i>

331
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,536
And you've been living here ever since?

332
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,080
That's right. I also did an arc
on <i>The Good Wife.</i>

333
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,791
-Other than that, laying low.
-<i>The Good Wife?</i>

334
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:07,044
How did you go on a nationally broadcast
TV show with no one catching you?

335
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:11,424
I disappeared into the role, BoJack.
It's called acting. Try it sometime.

336
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,634
And you're the one
who's been stealing our food.

337
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,344
You already know too much.

338
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,762
Smoke bomb.
Hi-yah!

339
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:21,809
-Why did you throw a plum on the floor?
-Thought it was a smoke bomb.

340
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,227
Where are my smoke bombs?

341
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:25,187
I'm gonna go sleep by the pool.

342
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:28,733
-Hey. BoJack's back.
-Yup.

343
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,944
My two favorite people
in a room together with me.

344
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:34,071
-You bet.
-Isn't this great, BoJack?

345
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,990
-The three of us under one roof?
-Yeah.

346
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,034
It's like <i>Three Men and a Baby.</i>

347
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,454
But there's only two men,
and the baby's a lady.

348
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,788
Uh-huh.

349
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,600
<i>With all this turmoil and upheaval,</i>

350
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,394
sure would be nice to have
something you can depend on.

351
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,230
Something that arrives every day
at your doorstep,

352
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,732
with a robust arts section.

353
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,984
Let me tell you something
about the <i>L.A. Gazette.</i>

354
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:14,695
<i>I don't think you finished the story</i>
<i>about your publicist.</i>

355
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:18,115
What happened when you told her
you wanted to know her?

356
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,367
Oh, right. Well...

357
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,536
If we're gonna work together
and also have weird kinky car sex,

358
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,080
I wanna know something about you.

359
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,247
What do you wanna know?

360
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:28,209
I was married once.
I have a son I'm not allowed to see.

361
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,087
-My favorite fruit is honeydew.
-Gross, is that true?

362
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,046
Does it matter?

363
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,131
Listen, I've been
with guys like you before,

364
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:37,468
and I know this thing works better
if we keep a little distance.

365
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,511
And...

366
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,806
- Well, that worked.
- Okay, we're done. I'll see you tomorrow.

367
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,850
<i>So, that's how you left things?</i>

368
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:47,687
<i>That's how she left things.</i>
<i>But then I followed her home.</i>

369
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,063
<i>You did what?</i>

370
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,607
<i>She lives in this</i>
<i>tiny apartment in the Valley.</i>

371
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:56,070
<i>I could see her through the window</i>
<i>and I just watched her being... normal.</i>

372
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,364
Oh!

373
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,740
<i>There's something very intimate</i>

374
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:02,201
<i>about watching a person be herself.</i>

375
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:05,079
<i>But it wasn't good intimate,</i>
<i>like when you see your mom cry.</i>

376
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,247
<i>It was bad intimate,</i>

377
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,457
<i>like when your dad writes a poem</i>
<i>about Lena Horne's nipples,</i>

378
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,085
<i>makes you read it out loud</i>
<i>so he can hear if it scans.</i>

379
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,546
<i>She warned you</i>
<i>that you wouldn't want to know her.</i>

380
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,714
<i>Yeah. She was right.</i>

381
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:19,885
<i>It's so sad that when you see someone</i>
<i>as they really are, it ruins them.</i>

382
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:23,097
-Do you have someone you can talk to?
-About what?

383
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:27,226
<i>These feelings you have,</i>
<i>your self-destructive behavior.</i>

384
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:30,104
You know that old joke
about how many psychiatrists

385
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:33,399
does it take to screw in a light bulb?
The answer is just one,

386
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,860
but the light bulb has to want to change?

387
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,988
-I don't know that joke.
-That's it. That's the whole joke.

388
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,073
The light bulb has to want to change.

389
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:44,744
Yeah. Psychiatrists are idiots.

390
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,829
<i>That's actually not the point of the joke.</i>

391
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,415
-Hey. I need to talk to you.
-What the... I'm on the phone.

392
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:54,003
I got nominated for the Craig Noel Award
from the San Diego Theatre Critics Circle.

393
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,546
Oh, it's too much heat.

394
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,673
I'm taking your boat out
to international waters.

395
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,341
You never saw me.

396
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,801
On the phone.

397
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,553
I don't want to talk to anybody.

398
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,889
What I want is to have control
over my own life.

399
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,479
Which is why I'm begging you

400
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:13,981
to please cancel my delivery
of the <i>L.A. Gazette.</i>

401
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:16,692
-I don't think you want to do that.
-I promise you I do.

402
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,319
No, because that's just theater.

403
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:23,532
It allows you to think you're in control,
but the whole idea of control is a myth.

404
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,951
The universe is a wild beast.

405
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:30,706
<i>You can't tame it.</i>
<i>All you can do is try to live inside it.</i>

406
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,042
Live inside the beast?
That's a mixed metaphor.

407
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,795
-But... you're right.
<i>-Great.</i>

408
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,380
I'm going to sign you up
for another six months.

409
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:42,343
Since you've been such a sport,
I'm throwing in a tote bag.

410
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,054
Thanks.
You've given me a lot to think about.

411
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:49,183
Okay, so I'm a passenger.

412
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:52,978
Remember the three D's:
drive safely, drive efficiently,

413
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:55,105
and don't harass the passenger.

414
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:59,527
-Todd, can I talk to you for a second?
-Sure. Driver, pull over, please.

415
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,491
-Can I talk to you alone?
-Of course.

416
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,910
Driver, put up the partition, please.

417
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:14,583
I've been thinking,
and you should do this without me.

418
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:17,127
What? But the whole point
is we're doing it together.

419
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:18,879
But you don't need me anymore.

420
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,631
You have a whole team of coders,

421
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:23,717
and I don't think that I can work
in this house.

422
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:25,636
-What's wrong with the house?
-Todd, I just--

423
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,888
I need to go.

424
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:29,598
I don't understand.

425
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,892
Did I do something
to make you feel uncomfortable?

426
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:36,230
No. You are great. It's me and... BoJack.

427
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:39,233
BoJack?
What did he do this time?

428
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,905
I don't think
I've been a very good friend to you.

429
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:47,366
Things happened and...

430
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:51,287
I don't think BoJack's been
a very good friend to you either.

431
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:56,208
-Oh, okay.
-You should buy me out of the company.

432
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:58,210
No, no, no, keep your share.

433
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:00,462
Who knows?
It might be worth something someday.

434
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:01,755
You're sweet, Todd.

435
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,341
You shouldn't waste that on people
who don't deserve it.

436
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:07,970
Hey, you want this plum?
I found it in the kitchen.

437
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,013
Sure.

438
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,598
Whoa!

439
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:14,435
Weird plum.

440
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,648
How did you know where I live?

441
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:20,983
-Ana...
-You need to leave.

442
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,777
No, I know that it's exciting
to remain mysterious and in control,

443
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,112
but control is a myth.

444
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,656
That's a conclusion
I came to recently by myself.

445
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,824
I can't do this now.

446
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,702
I don't want to go home tonight.
I want to sleep in your bed,

447
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,787
I wanna see what
you look like waking up.

448
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:37,249
You are a beautiful,
sexy, fascinating, terrifying woman.

449
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:40,085
And I want to know you.
I'm not afraid of that.

450
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:41,920
And you don't have to be, either.

451
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,299
Okay.

452
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:49,011
And I want to go with the mirror ads
for <i>Secretariat.</i>

453
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,387
-BoJack, no, listen.
-Ana.

454
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:52,389
This is my campaign,
I know what I'm doing.

455
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:55,434
Call up Turteltaub and tell him
I won't be pushed around on this.

456
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,394
I'm the star and what I say goes.

457
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,189
Okay.

458
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,193
Hmm...

459
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,945
It kind of just looks like
a billboard for the sky.

460
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:09,114
-I didn't think this part through.
-No kidding.

461
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:12,910
The sky is Secretariat? The sky
wants you to nominate it for an Oscar?

462
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,828
It is eerily beautiful.

463
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:17,456
Like an art piece
that resists interpretation.

464
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:21,126
Oh, good. Yeah. Wouldn't want the ad
for my movie to be interpretable.

465
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,628
If you stand where I'm standing,

466
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,089
you see a reflection
of the KIIS-FM billboard.

467
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:28,634
Beautiful. So we spent half a million
dollars on an Oscar campaign for KIIS-FM.

468
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,427
I'd hate to drive here at rush hour.

469
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:33,097
When the sun goes down
and hits that billboard,

470
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,809
that's gonna--
That's gonna be a real problem.

471
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,978
Well, the good news is
BoJack got what he wanted.

472
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:45,067
