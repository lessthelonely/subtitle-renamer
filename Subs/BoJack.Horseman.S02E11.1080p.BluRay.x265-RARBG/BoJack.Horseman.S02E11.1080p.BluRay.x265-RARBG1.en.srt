1
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:12,304
What are you doing here?

2
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,765
You said if I was in town
to give you a call.

3
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,976
- Wanna get a drink?
- It's eight in the morning.

4
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,478
It's 5 P.M. in Los Angeles.

5
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,980
- That's not true.
- I actually don't know what time it is.

6
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,691
When's the last time you slept?
You look like shit.

7
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,402
Really? 'Cause you look like a million...

8
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:31,031
- Yeah, let's get you back to my place.
- What about the store?

9
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:33,492
What if somebody has an emergency
and they need more...

10
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:34,826
Turquoise shit?

11
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:36,119
It's new Mexico.

12
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,286
They'll find it.

13
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,998
- It's really good to see you.
- It's good to see you, too.

14
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,584
I can't wait for you
to meet Kyle and the kids.

15
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,671
Kyle and the kids? Please tell me
that's the name of your band.

16
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,677
Kyle and the kids

17
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:55,180
Kyle is the dad
and Charlotte is married to him

18
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,516
and they've got some kids

19
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:59,685
there's penny
she's going to high school

20
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:02,062
and she's got a brother

21
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:04,398
her brother's name is trip

22
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:07,067
they're the perfect family

23
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:09,403
Kyle and the kids

24
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,864
he loves his wife
and there's nothing you can do

25
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:14,575
Kyle and the kids

26
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:19,830
nothing's gonna be all right
be all right, oh, no

27
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:22,124
so, who are you again?

28
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,418
You were friends with mom
when she lived in L.A.?

29
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:28,088
Your mom never mentioned she used
to hang out with the bojack horseman?

30
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,424
Star of screen and... book?

31
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,218
- Wait, mom lived in Los Angeles?
- Never came up?

32
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:35,304
- All these years?
- It was a long time ago.

33
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,848
Oh, gross. Mom, trip has a boner again.

34
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,778
- Trip.
- Trip, let's dial back the boners.

35
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,476
- Gross.
- What? I can't help it.

36
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,363
- Trip, ew.
- You are at the breakfast table

37
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:46,189
with your parents, your big sister,
and an old man.

38
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:49,568
- What could possibly be arousing you?
- Am I the old man?

39
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,236
I don't understand how it works.

40
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:54,615
I was just excited that I finished
the maze on the back of the cereal box.

41
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,575
So, bojack. What brings you to tesuque?

42
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:58,493
So, we're just gonna change
the subject

43
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,246
and pretend trip isn't being a huge perv
right now?

44
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:02,748
Yeah, penny, that's the plan.

45
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,334
Talking about it makes it worse.
It likes attention.

46
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,419
Charlotte told me if I was ever
in new Mexico

47
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:09,838
- I should call her.
- But why are you in new Mexico?

48
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,091
- Yeah, what are you doing in new Mexico?
- I, uh...

49
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:16,386
You didn't drive all this way
just to see my mom, did you?

50
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,096
No, of course not.

51
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,890
That would be crazy,

52
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,225
to come all this way just to see a woman

53
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,895
I haven't had a real conversation with
in 30 years.

54
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,231
- I mean, obviously that would be crazy.
- Uh...

55
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,318
- Because she has a family, which is great.
- Yeah.

56
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,487
- You guys are great.
- Yeah.

57
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:36,740
So, I'm just here to, you know, say hello.

58
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,326
- Mm.
- On my way to see...

59
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,702
- On your way to sea?
- Yes.

60
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,913
To the sea. To the shining sea.

61
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:45,123
Because I'm here to buy... a boat.

62
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,794
- At the... Santa fe boat show.
- I've never heard of a Santa fe boat show.

63
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,296
That's 'cause... it's a secret boat show.

64
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:52,463
- Invitation-only.
- Huh.

65
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:57,219
Mostly athletes and visiting dignitaries
and big-time celebrities and... kings.

66
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:58,220
- Wow.
- Hold up.

67
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:01,723
If you live in Los Angeles,
which is right on the ocean,

68
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,226
why would you drive all the way here
to go to a boat show

69
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:07,771
- in the middle of landlocked new Mexico?
- Jeez, so many questions.

70
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,856
What is this,
hollywoo stars and celebrities,

71
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,484
what do they know,
do they know things, let's find out?

72
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:16,363
0h, gotta take this.
It's my... boat... guy.

73
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,948
- Heho?
- Okay, so I got turtel...

74
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,658
Hey, knute.

75
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,494
- You got any leads for me, boat-wise?
- What?

76
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:23,662
Sounds perfect, knute.

77
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:26,331
- Now tell me, do we need a poop deck?
- Huh?

78
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:28,959
- Well, if Leo has one, then I want one.
- Bojackn

79
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:33,505
in fact, I want two, two poop decks.
Sorry about that. What's going on?

80
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,632
- Where the hell are you?
- Tesuque.

81
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,342
- Te-who-ka?
- Tesuque, new Mexico.

82
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:39,511
- Outside Santa fe.
- Are you te-stupid?

83
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:43,181
If you don't get your ass back te-set,
you're gonna get te-sued.

84
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,351
- Just get me a couple of days.
- For what? What are you doing there?

85
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:47,758
I don't know, I just...

86
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:49,229
This isn't what I expected.

87
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:52,399
Well, I can probably stave them off
till Monday if you get pinkeye.

88
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,046
- Can you get pinkeye?
- I have to go.

89
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,486
Wait, bojack, when are you coming back?

90
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,447
Soon. Yep, I want the starboard

91
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,282
- to be fully starboard.
- What?

92
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:03,034
- And the port to be... also starboard.
- Huh?

93
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,925
- Thanks a lot. Goodbye.
- Wait, bojack...

94
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,788
- Hey.
- I'm really glad you're here.

95
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,832
Oh, yeah... uh, me, too.

96
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,751
I hope this isn't weird for you.

97
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,919
You know, me having a family and...

98
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,421
Why would it be weird?

99
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,340
At our age,
it's weird if you don't have a family.

100
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,676
- I mean...
- Well, not for you.

101
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,219
- No.
- 'Cause you've been busy.

102
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,466
- Right.
- With your career.

103
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:25,807
Sure, yeah,
my career has kept me super busy.

104
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,643
Anyway, I know you're just in town
for the boat show,

105
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,687
but seriously... make yourself at home.

106
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,397
I really don't want to impose.

107
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,733
If there's anything I can do
to help around here...

108
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,403
Mom, dad was supposed to take me driving
after school today,

109
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,406
but now he's gotta take trip
to his dumb-ass basketball game.

110
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:44,534
- It's the quarter-finals.
- You'll get a hard-on during the game.

111
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,871
Now I'll get a hard-on because
you made me think about it. Thanks a lot.

112
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:51,333
- I'll take you driving this weekend.
- I need to practice every day.

113
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,710
I'm the only senior
who still doesn't have a license.

114
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,045
It's embarrassing.

115
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,923
Well, I got the store,
and I already took the morning off,

116
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,925
so unless you know any other adults...

117
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,091
Can bojack take me?

118
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:01,885
- Huh?
- What?

119
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,678
- I mean, he is an adult.
- Uh...

120
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,597
Well, I mean, if it's okay with bojack.

121
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:08,433
You'd really be doing me a huge favor.

122
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,687
Well, I guess I could make some time...
Before the boat show.

123
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,568
Keep your eyes on the road
and hands on the wheel.

124
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,904
- Okay.
- And don't text and drive,

125
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,322
unless it's an emergency,

126
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:25,617
like you have a really funny thing
that you just have to text someone.

127
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,745
- Got it.
- So, let me ask you something. Tsk.

128
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,705
Do your parents really love each other,

129
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,958
or is it
a stay-together-for-the-kids situation?

130
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,835
What? Why would you ask me that?

131
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,795
I don't know. Just making conversation.

132
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:39,798
- Why do we keep passing the same house?
- No, I don't. Shut up.

133
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:42,884
You shut up. What's the story?
Cute guy live there? Girl you hate?

134
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,678
College kid that gives you Adderall?

135
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,304
Okay, fine.

136
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,348
That's Diego mendoza's house.

137
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:49,975
He's just this stupid guy.

138
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,853
He's in my calculus class,
and sometimes we'll do this thing

139
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,564
where he goes, "hey,"
and then I go, "hey."

140
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,941
Then he goes, "what's the homework?"
And I tell him.

141
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:01,486
It's not like a big deal or anything,
but it's like this thing we do.

142
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,363
- Cool thing.
- So, anyway...

143
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,575
My best friend, Alison f.
Was talking to Rachel kaplan.

144
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,501
Do ireally need
to know their names?

145
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,418
Rachel heard from ray-ray
and the bean

146
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,372
that Diego said
if prom happened right now

147
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,624
he'd want to go with am sand/er,
and I'm like,

148
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,127
"yeah, pfft, okay, dude."
You know what I mean?

149
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,814
I don't know these people.
You know I don't know these people.

150
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:22,507
But then he said
since prom's not for another two months,

151
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,594
he could "foresee a situation"
where he would want to go with me,

152
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,847
because he knows I'm a real girl
who's mostly chill.

153
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,892
If you're so mostly chill,
why do you keep driving by his house?

154
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,936
In case he comes out,
to, like, check the mail or something.

155
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,772
I'll get out of the car and be like,
"that's so funny.

156
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,190
I was just going for a drive."

157
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,943
And he'll be like, "oh, hey."
And I'll be like, "hey."

158
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,488
- 'Cause that's our thing, you know? Heh.
- That's the whole plan?

159
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,950
Well, it's better than your plan
for buying a boat in new Mexico.

160
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,537
Dude, what are you really doing here?

161
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:58,960
I didn't... like the person I was in la.

162
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:02,589
And I didn't know where else to go.

163
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,966
- Please do not tell your parents.
- Well, I won't,

164
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,593
but I think people are gonna notice

165
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,000
if you go to a boat show
and don't come back with a boat.

166
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,082
Oh, my god, there he is. Get down!

167
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,743
- Oh, my god. Oh!
- What are you doing?

168
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,852
- What happened to your plan?
- Oh! I panicked.

169
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,438
I didn't know
he'd be wearing a tank top.

170
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,861
- Don't tell my parents I crashed your car.
- Yeah, deal.

171
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,034
- They didn't even put me in.
- I'm sorry, sweetheart.

172
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,054
But you did some great
cheering from the bench,

173
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:35,205
and for someone who never plays,
you sweat a lot.

174
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,832
- Maybe they'll put me in next game.
- Sure, they will.

175
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,751
No way they'll do that.

176
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,754
- What the...?
- Huh?

177
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,589
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

178
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:45,882
What a boat.

179
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,277
- Can I go on your boat?
- I don't see what's stopping you.

180
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:51,513
Yeah! Woohoo! I'm going on a boat!
I got my way!

181
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,680
Where's your car?

182
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,891
Ijunked it.
Who needs a car when you got a boat?

183
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,769
- Uh... well...
- Whoa, sweet, a waterbed.

184
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:01,147
On a boat!
Think of the amount of floating!

185
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,941
Please stay out of the bedroom.

186
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,484
- Does she have a name?
- Who?

187
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:08,029
- The boat? It does not.
- Come on. You gotta give her a name.

188
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,240
You should call her the escape from la.

189
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,118
That actually is a good name for it,
the nongendered object.

190
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,953
Oh, she's a good girl.

191
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,039
I can tell, she's a good girl, isn't she?

192
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,167
- Or are you a bad girl?
- Are you flirting with my boat right now?

193
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,254
No, just kidding around.
I'm kind of the comedian of the family.

194
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,798
- Mind if I get on top of her?
- Knock yourself out.

195
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,466
Dad, don't be gross.

196
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,927
- Wow, you really got a boat.
- Yeah, sure did.

197
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,887
So, does that mean you're leaving?

198
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,556
Oh, I, uh...

199
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:38,810
Yeah, I guess, uh... I guess I did...
Do what I came here to do.

200
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:42,814
You don't have to go right away, right?
At least stay till the end of the weekend.

201
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:45,608
- Yeah? I don't wanna put you out.
- Oh, it's no bother.

202
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:49,738
And at least now you have your own bed.
Besides... heh, everyone here loves you.

203
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,114
Uh, everyone?

204
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,783
Don't use the bathroom.
It'll end up in the driveway.

205
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,203
- Too late.
- Seriously, stay as long as you want.

206
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,750
- What?
- Bojack, great news.

207
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,502
Do you still want to go to New York?
Because Jill pill...

208
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,069
Jill pill? I don't care about this.

209
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,049
Okay, moving on. Do you remember
when we were at herb's funeral

210
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,509
- and you told me...?
- Whatever it is, I don't care.

211
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,836
Oh, there's a kitchen!
Can we make pizza bagels?

212
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,322
Yeah, family dinner on the boat.

213
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,558
Hey, uh, I'm not gonna be back
on set Monday.

214
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,853
What? How long do I have
to keep putting out fires for you?

215
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,564
I don't know, Princess Carolyn.
Just let them burn.

216
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,858
- What?
- I think I might be here a while.

217
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,610
Listen, I...

218
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,116
Well, who's getting seasick?

219
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,578
Just kidding.

220
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,581
It's such an eyesore.

221
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:45,168
Well, I'm sure if we ask them nicely,
they'll move the boat.

222
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,592
Bojack?

223
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,761
- Yeah?
- Supper's ready.

224
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:58,056
So, I had another meeting today
with the drama chair at sfcc.

225
00:09:58,223 --> 00:09:59,974
They're gonna offer me a position.

226
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,894
- What? That's amazing.
- Oh, that's cool. Congratulations.

227
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:06,981
There's a real stick-in-the-mud Dean there
who doesn't like my in-your-face style.

228
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:11,945
If I know me, it might lead
to some pretty zany misadventures.

229
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,822
Mm. Brussels sprouts are delicious, mom.

230
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:17,700
It's funny you brought up the Brussels
sprouts, because I think they're terrible.

231
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,621
I'm just kidding around.
These are great, hon.

232
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,041
Penny, did you hear my bit
about the Brussels sprouts?

233
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,002
A bit is what they call a joke
in show business.

234
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,629
- Right, bojack?
- That's right.

235
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,215
String a bunch of those together
and you got yourself a riff.

236
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:35,718
You're not funny, dad.
Your jokes are never funny.

237
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,804
Okay... I think someone's in a mood.

238
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,264
Oh, my god. I'm not in a mood.

239
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,099
Whatever. Get bent.

240
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,268
I hate my life. I can't wait to be dead.

241
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,914
I'll talk to her.

242
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,147
Everyone said for months

243
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,274
- that Diego was gonna ask me to prom.
- Yeah?

244
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,235
- But he keeps not doing it.
- That is so typical Diego.

245
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:55,280
So, I thought, okay,
if he's not going to ask me, I'll ask him.

246
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,174
- Way to take initiative.
- Oh. Rookie mistake.

247
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,825
So, I asked him and he said no.

248
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,620
And then this other girl Lyla k.
Came up to him and was just like, "hey."

249
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,206
And he was like, "hey."
And that's our thing.

250
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,417
Well, I don't want to tell tales
out of school,

251
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:11,713
but this Lyla k. Character
sounds like a real bust-ass super-skank.

252
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,383
Thank you, that is exactly what she is.
It's weird that nobody talks about it.

253
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,136
Well, you know, sometimes it's nice
to not have a date,

254
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:19,804
- because you can actually...
- Mom.

255
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:23,641
I can't go to the prom without a date.
It's not like when you were in high school

256
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,144
- and you'd go to your sock hops.
- Do you think

257
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:29,230
- I went to high school in the '503?
- Penny, hey, I got an idea.

258
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,957
- You should take me to the prom.
- Huh?

259
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,775
Everybody loves having bojack around.

260
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:33,942
What? Why?

261
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,654
Think about it. If you went with Diego,
you'd be nervous.

262
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,281
"Does he like me? Am I cool?"

263
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:41,284
But with me you can just relax
and enjoy yourself.

264
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,661
Diego will see you
have a good time without him,

265
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,246
and that'll make him superjealous.

266
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,832
So, he'll come up to you,
and he'll say, "hey."

267
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,459
And then you say, "hey."

268
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,461
- Oh, that's so cold.
- Right?

269
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,838
- Wait...
- Rachel kaplan's gonna shit herself.

270
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,132
- How is that cold?
- Then he'll say, "wanna dance?"

271
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,760
And you'll say,
"I'm busy right now. Maybe later."

272
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:01,721
And then... never dance with him.

273
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,973
- That'll show him.
- Wait... I'm sorry.

274
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,860
- Don't you want to dance with Diego?
- Stop poking holes, Charlotte.

275
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:09,187
- This is a great plan.
- Yeah, mom, don't poke holes.

276
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,439
Hey, dad, bojack's taking me to prom!

277
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:16,277
Oh, Yeah, well,
that's definitely the better idea.

278
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,490
Okay, everyone smile. Real big.

279
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,909
- Cheese.
- I think we have enough pictures.

280
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,328
Oh, come on, it's your first prom.
Indulge us.

281
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,997
Taking pictures before prom
is so bourgeois.

282
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,207
And who are you again?

283
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,793
- I'm maddy.
- Maddy's my best friend.

284
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,172
- I thought Alison f. Was your best friend.
- That was like three best friends ago.

285
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:39,842
You were best friends
with Alison f.?

286
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,845
- No.
- Hey, bojack, I'm Pete.

287
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,891
But they call me Pete repeat
because I always say everything twice.

288
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:49,894
- Everything?
- Yeah, it's kind of my thing.

289
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,229
- Okay.
- Ah, damn.

290
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,940
I forgot to say that twice, didn't I?
Usually I do it.

291
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,107
Cool.

292
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:01,322
Wow, ray-ray and the bean
are already posting pics on Instagram.

293
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,199
- What?
- Hashtag much?

294
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,200
Let me see.

295
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,160
Whoa, hold on. Responsible adult.

296
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,037
- What are you drinking?
- Nothing.

297
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,999
- Hand it over.
- Fine.

298
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:15,336
Ugh. Red bull and vodka? What are you, 12?
You'll get sick drinking all that sugar.

299
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,298
Do they teach you anything in school?
Make a left at the light.

300
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,758
- Where are we going?
- I'll get you some bourbon.

301
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,803
And you'll cut it with water.
That way you don't get hungover.

302
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:24,970
Wait, really?

303
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:27,432
If you're gonna drink,
you should be smart about it.

304
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,435
Awesome. Wait.
How many times did I just say "awesome"?

305
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,979
Was it twice or was it once?
Ah, it was probably twice.

306
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,315
Yeah, it's twice. Pete repeat.

307
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:44,490
- Ugh. It burns.
- Yeah, 'cause it's not a juice box.

308
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,867
You want some?

309
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,261
- No, thanks.
- Pussy.

310
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,285
I'm driving.

311
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,203
Well, more for me.

312
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,414
This prom is really bourgeois.

313
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:55,043
- Lyla k. Is so pretty.
- Shut up. She's got nothing on you.

314
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:58,838
Why is nobody dancing?
We gotta get this party started.

315
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,007
Beat it, Poindexter.

316
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,054
- Poindexter?
- It's a nerd reference...

317
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,217
- Just beat it.
- Ah!

318
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,362
Huh?

319
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,488
- Hey!
- What's the big idea?

320
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:10,016
Why is there an adult
at our high-school prom?

321
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,226
All right, folks.
We're taking it back to 1991,

322
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:16,064
when a new funky-fresh dance craze
took this nation by storm.

323
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,790
- All right.
- I'm listening.

324
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:20,360
As a teen, I'm open to new experiences.

325
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:24,530
Ready for the chorus, stay on the beat,
and here... we... go. Wokka wokka.

326
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,200
Now boys and girls,
if you wanna do the bojack,

327
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,494
- take your hands and put them on your...
- Boo!

328
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,537
- This sucks.
- This guy's bad.

329
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,104
Oh, no. God, no! This is not
the immediate praise I expected.

330
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,128
This prom sucks.

331
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,295
You can say that again.

332
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,423
- I know.
- My flask got empty.

333
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:46,010
Can we be back to the car,
so, for more get for put in it?

334
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,137
Or we could go back to the car
and just leave.

335
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:51,849
- You can't just leave the prom.
- Of course you can. You're young.

336
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,351
You can do whatever you want.

337
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:54,852
That's what they never tell you

338
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,355
until it's too late.
You don't have to be here.

339
00:14:57,522 --> 00:15:00,191
Yeah, he's right. Society is everywhere.

340
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:03,194
- Society.
- Well, what else are we gonna do?

341
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,655
I'd say it's time to get down,
time to hit the town.

342
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,366
Is that a lyric
from that "do the bojack" song?

343
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,451
Just get in the car.

344
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,964
Okay, one... two... three.

345
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,970
Wow. That is so beautiful.

346
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,348
Hey, you wanna climb up
on the water tower?

347
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:33,933
We could see the whole city.

348
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,060
Yeah, I wanna go.

349
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:37,645
Oh.

350
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,230
Oh, careful there, maddy.

351
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,107
Actually, I'm gonna stay right here.

352
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,109
This is nice.

353
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,363
Wow, how'd you think to do all this?

354
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,740
I don't know. It just came to me.

355
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,160
I'm really glad we left that stupid prom,

356
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:55,079
but I'm kind of bummed
we didn't get to dance.

357
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:57,165
Well, you wanna dance?

358
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,000
Yes, hold on.

359
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:00,334
Got it, okay.

360
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,589
It's buffering.

361
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:08,009
Buffering still, buffering.

362
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:11,137
This night has been... so perfect.

363
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,306
You know, you look just like your mother.

364
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,059
Guys?

365
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,479
I think you should come down here.

366
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,440
She's still breathing,
but she won't wake up.

367
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,276
She just had too much to drink.
Take her back to your place.

368
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:27,403
- She can spend the night.
- Maddy, come on.

369
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,281
No, look, my cousin had a friend
who passed out like this,

370
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:33,242
and she died of alcohol poisoning, man.

371
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,370
I really think we should get maddy
to a hospital, to a hospital.

372
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:39,540
Did you see what I did there?
That's why they call me Pete repeat.

373
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,084
Bojack, what do we do?

374
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,716
- Society.
- Careful.

375
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,134
- I'm being careful.
- Okay.

376
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,969
- Lock the wheels.
- Watch her head.

377
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,555
Maddy's gonna be just fine.
They'll know what to do here.

378
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:55,723
Pete, you're in charge.

379
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,725
- Penny and I are gonna take off.
- What?

380
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,229
You don't want too many people around
in a hospital setting.

381
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,564
If anyone asks,
tell them we left the dance early,

382
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,108
and you don't know
where maddy got the whiskey.

383
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,026
Why?

384
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,654
It's one thing if a bunch of kids
get drunk on prom night,

385
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,698
but if there's an adult there,
I was supposed to be responsible,

386
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,034
and then the whole thing feels
kind of creepy.

387
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,577
Are you sure she's gonna be okay?

388
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,454
- I don't know, bojack.
- Pete.

389
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,790
I'm the adult here,
and I need you to listen to me.

390
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,793
Penny and I left early.
You don't know who gave maddy whiskey.

391
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,044
Are we clear on this?

392
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,046
I need you to be 100 percent with me here.

393
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,258
Just listen to him.
He knows what he's doing.

394
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,664
It's gonna be okay.
Where did maddy get the alcohol from?

395
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:35,596
I... I don't know.

396
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,599
And what happened to your friends
bojack and penny?

397
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,685
They left early.

398
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,520
See, that's not so hard.

399
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:45,314
You're doing the right thing.
Don't forget that.

400
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,193
- Okay.
- Is it okay?

401
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,112
Or "okay" okay?

402
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,198
- Uh... "Okay" okay.
- All right, that's what I thought.

403
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:57,034
You're the future of america!
Go, penny! Go, go, go!

404
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,540
- She's gonna be okay, right?
- She'll be fine.

405
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:03,833
It's a part of growing up.

406
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,420
And we did the right thing back there,
you think?

407
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,381
I...
Look, sometimes when you're an adult,

408
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,550
the right thing
isn't always the best thing.

409
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:13,801
Well...

410
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,846
I had a really good time tonight.

411
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:18,806
Even with all the craziness.

412
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,725
This was really special.

413
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,059
I'm glad.

414
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,229
You know, everyone always treats me
like a kid.

415
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:28,899
You're the first grown-up I've ever met
who actually treats me like...

416
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,693
You know, a person.

417
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,738
So, thanks. Mwah.

418
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,531
- Well, you're welcome, penny.
- Mm...

419
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:38,284
- Whoa, penny, come on.
- If you want to do it, I'm ready.

420
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,078
I have condoms in my room.
I can put one on with my mouth.

421
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,664
- With your mouth?
- I put one on a banana in health class.

422
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,208
With your mouth?
What kind of health class...?

423
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,711
Look, you are an amazing person,
but you're 17.

424
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,297
Which is the legal age of consent
in new Mexico.

425
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:52,548
Okay, that's not...

426
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,343
And I didn't drink tonight,
so everything's totally legal.

427
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,304
- Penny, no.
- It's okay. I want this.

428
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,348
No, you think you do, but...

429
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,516
You don't know what you want.

430
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,395
Oh, god.

431
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:07,772
This is so dumb.

432
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,733
- No, penny, don't...
- I'll see you tomorrow.

433
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:18,908
Hey.

434
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,535
- What'd you do with my daughter?
- She had a big night.

435
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,538
She was falling asleep on the ride home.
Where are the boys?

436
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,916
Trip's at a friend's house
and Kyle's asleep.

437
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,337
- You know you can get your own, right?
- Hey, do you remember that time

438
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,923
you, me and herb let those balloons go
over studio city?

439
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:37,385
Oh, yeah. Didn't we attach glow sticks
to them or something?

440
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,820
- Yeah.
- Ooh. That was really bad

441
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:39,679
for the environment.

442
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,555
- True, but...
- A sea gull could've choked

443
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,517
- on one of those balloons.
- But it's a nice memory, right?

444
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,227
It was a fun night.

445
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,354
We had a lot of fun nights.

446
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,732
Before you left town,
you told me L.A. was a tar pit.

447
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,275
- Do you remember?
- Oh, god.

448
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,445
I said so many things when I was young.
I thought I was so deep.

449
00:19:56,612 --> 00:20:00,449
- Well, do you still think it's true?
- Do I think la. Is a tar pit?

450
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,744
No, I think you're the tar pit.

451
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,414
- Me?
- No, not "you" you.

452
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,165
I'm just saying, like...

453
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,960
It doesn't matter where you are,
it's who you are,

454
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:13,754
and that's not gonna change
whether you're in California

455
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,966
or Maine or new Mexico.

456
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:19,427
You know, you can't escape... you.

457
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:24,390
- Ugh. Now you sound like my mother.
- No, what? No, I don't.

458
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:30,312
- I don't know what to do, Charlotte.
- About what?

459
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,315
I keep... making these bad decisions.

460
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,527
- And hurting people.
- Well...

461
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:39,572
- Can I tell you a joke?
- Is it a long joke with no punch line?

462
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,031
- No.
- Then go ahead.

463
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:45,411
Guy goes into the doctor's office.
Says, "doctor, it hurts when I do this."

464
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,787
You know what the doctor says?

465
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,415
- "Don't do that."
- Yeah.

466
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,543
- That's actually... good advice.
- And you know what else?

467
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,421
The doctor in that story was a woman.

468
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:56,630
What?!

469
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:07,641
Oh. Bojack, um...

470
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,519
- I think you got the wrong idea.
- Let's go.

471
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,730
- Let's get out of here right now.
- No, bojack.

472
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:14,273
You and me, this is real.

473
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,734
- You know this is real.
- My husband is right upstairs.

474
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:19,487
I don't care about your husband.
All that matters is us.

475
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:22,323
- Don't do this, bojack.
- I know you feel it, too.

476
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,658
So many times in my life
I've done the wrong thing,

477
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:25,951
but this is the right thing,

478
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,329
and I have never been more sure
of anything.

479
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:30,581
I've wasted so much time sitting
on my hands

480
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:32,750
and imagining what could have been.

481
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:36,295
Tell me you don't feel the same.
Tell me you haven't thought about it.

482
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,841
- I think you should go.
- Okay.

483
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:41,801
- Tomorrow.
- Charlotte...

484
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,553
I have worked very hard to build this life
for myself.

485
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,721
I am happy here.

486
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,432
And you just roll into my life
like a hurricane.

487
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:51,894
Why? Because we knew each other
for five minutes 30 years ago?

488
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,437
- I don't know you.
- You do.

489
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:55,689
I don't. And you don't know me.

490
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,526
No, please.
These last few months have been amazing.

491
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,611
- I love you, your family and this town.
- Stop.

492
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:02,446
- I never wanted to hurt...
- Bojackn

493
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:05,825
I'm sorry I kissed you. I shouldn't have.
We can pretend it didn't happen.

494
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,869
- Everything can go back to normal, but...
- No, no, stop. No.

495
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,455
Please, don't make me go back to la.

496
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:14,917
I don't care where you go, bojack,
but I can't have you around here.

497
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,670
You make me too sad.

498
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,339
Okay.

499
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,387
What are you doing here?

500
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:29,348
I know what I want, bojack.

501
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,562
Go to bed, penny.

502
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,494
Wait, what?

503
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,795
Shh, shh, shh.
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

504
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:09,513
- No.
- Mom.

505
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,348
- Charlotte.
- Penny, go to your room.

506
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,726
- We didn't even do anything.
- Now, penny.

507
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:21,150
- Charlotte, I am so sorry...
- Don't. Don't you dare.

508
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,654
If you are not out of my driveway
in 30 minutes, I will call the police.

509
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:29,783
And if you ever try to contact me
or my family again,

510
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,161
I will fucking kill you.

511
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:32,888
Hey.

512
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:34,556
Hey.

513
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,100
You're still here?

514
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:39,019
Yup, still here.

515
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:42,940
Back in the '90s

516
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:48,779
I was in a very famous TV show

517
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,491
-I'm bojack the horse -bojack!

518
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:57,913
Bojack the horse
don't act like you don't know

519
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:03,961
and I'm trying to hold onto my past

520
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:08,757
it's been so long
I don't think I'm gonna last

521
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:12,469
I guess I was trying
to make you understand

522
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:16,765
that I'm more horse than a man

523
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:21,478
or I'm more man than a horse

524
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,022
bojack!
