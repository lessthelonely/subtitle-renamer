1
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:12,304
What are you doing here?

2
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,765
You said if I was in town
to give you a call.

3
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,976
- Wanna get a drink?
- It's eight in the morning.

4
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,478
It's 5 P.M. in Los Angeles.

5
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,980
- That's not true.
- I actually don't know what time it is.

6
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,691
When's the last time you slept?
You look like shit.

7
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,402
Really? 'Cause you look like a million...

8
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:31,031
- Yeah, let's get you back to my place.
- What about the store?

9
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:33,492
What if somebody has an emergency
and they need more...

10
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:34,826
Turquoise shit?

11
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:36,119
It's new Mexico.

12
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,286
They'll find it.

13
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,998
- It's really good to see you.
- It's good to see you, too.

14
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,584
I can't wait for you
to meet Kyle and the kids.

15
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,671
Kyle and the kids? Please tell me
that's the name of your band.

16
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,214
[Charlotte laughs]

17
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,677
Kyle and the kids

18
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:55,180
Kyle is the dad
and Charlotte is married to him

19
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,516
and they've got some kids

20
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:59,685
there's penny
she's going to high school

21
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:02,062
and she's got a brother

22
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:04,398
her brother's name is trip

23
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:07,067
they're the perfect family

24
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:09,403
Kyle and the kids

25
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,864
he loves his wife
and there's nothing you can do

26
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:14,575
Kyle and the kids

27
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:19,830
nothing's gonna be all right
be all right, oh, no

28
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:22,124
so, who are you again?

29
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,418
You were friends with mom
when she lived in L.A.?

30
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:28,088
Your mom never mentioned she used
to hang out with the bojack horseman?

31
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,424
Star of screen and... book?

32
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,218
- Wait, mom lived in Los Angeles?
- Never came up?

33
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:35,304
- All these years?
- It was a long time ago.

34
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,848
Oh, gross. Mom, trip has a boner again.

35
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,778
- Trip.
- Trip, let's dial back the boners.

36
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,476
- Gross.
- What? I can't help it.

37
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,363
- Trip, ew.
- You are at the breakfast table

38
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:46,189
with your parents, your big sister,
and an old man.

39
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:49,568
- What could possibly be arousing you?
- Am I the old man?

40
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,236
I don't understand how it works.

41
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:54,615
I was just excited that I finished
the maze on the back of the cereal box.

42
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,575
So, bojack. What brings you to tesuque?

43
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:58,493
So, we're just gonna change
the subject

44
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,246
and pretend trip isn't being a huge perv
right now?

45
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:02,748
Yeah, penny, that's the plan.

46
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,334
Talking about it makes it worse.
It likes attention.

47
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,419
Charlotte told me if I was ever
in new Mexico

48
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:09,838
- I should call her.
- But why are you in new Mexico?

49
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,091
- Yeah, what are you doing in new Mexico?
- I, uh...

50
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:16,386
You didn't drive all this way
just to see my mom, did you?

51
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,096
No, of course not.

52
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,890
That would be crazy,

53
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,225
to come all this way just to see a woman

54
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,895
I haven't had a real conversation with
in 30 years.

55
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,231
- I mean, obviously that would be crazy.
- Uh...

56
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,318
- Because she has a family, which is great.
- Yeah.

57
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,487
- You guys are great.
- Yeah.

58
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:36,740
So, I'm just here to, you know, say hello.

59
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,326
- Mm.
- On my way to see...

60
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,702
- On your way to sea?
- Yes.

61
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,913
To the sea. To the shining sea.

62
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:45,123
Because I'm here to buy... a boat.

63
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,794
- At the... Santa fe boat show.
- I've never heard of a Santa fe boat show.

64
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,296
That's 'cause... it's a secret boat show.

65
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:52,463
- Invitation-only.
- Huh.

66
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:57,219
Mostly athletes and visiting dignitaries
and big-time celebrities and... kings.

67
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:58,220
- Wow.
- [Penny] Hold up.

68
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:01,723
If you live in Los Angeles,
which is right on the ocean,

69
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,226
why would you drive all the way here
to go to a boat show

70
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:07,771
- in the middle of landlocked new Mexico?
- Jeez, so many questions.

71
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,856
What is this,
hollywoo stars and celebrities,

72
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,484
what do they know,
do they know things, let's find out?

73
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:13,485
[Cell phone ringing]

74
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:16,363
0h, gotta take this.
It's my... boat... guy.

75
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,948
- Heho?
- Okay, so I got turtel...

76
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,658
Hey, knute.

77
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,494
- You got any leads for me, boat-wise?
- What?

78
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:23,662
Sounds perfect, knute.

79
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:26,331
- Now tell me, do we need a poop deck?
- Huh?

80
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:28,959
- Well, if Leo has one, then I want one.
- Bojackn

81
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:33,505
in fact, I want two, two poop decks.
Sorry about that. What's going on?

82
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,632
- Where the hell are you?
- Tesuque.

83
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,342
- Te-who-ka?
- Tesuque, new Mexico.

84
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:39,511
- Outside Santa fe.
- Are you te-stupid?

85
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:43,181
If you don't get your ass back te-set,
you're gonna get te-sued.

86
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,351
- Just get me a couple of days.
- For what? What are you doing there?

87
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:47,758
I don't know, I just... [sighs]

88
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:49,229
This isn't what I expected.

89
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:52,399
Well, I can probably stave them off
till Monday if you get pinkeye.

90
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,046
- Can you get pinkeye?
- I have to go.

91
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,486
Wait, bojack, when are you coming back?

92
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,447
Soon. Yep, I want the starboard

93
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,282
- to be fully starboard.
- What?

94
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:03,034
- And the port to be... also starboard.
- Huh?

95
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,925
- Thanks a lot. Goodbye.
- Wait, bojack...

96
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,788
- Hey.
- I'm really glad you're here.

97
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,832
Oh, yeah... uh, me, too.

98
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,751
I hope this isn't weird for you.

99
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,919
You know, me having a family and...

100
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,421
Why would it be weird? [Chuckles]

101
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,340
At our age,
it's weird if you don't have a family.

102
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,676
- I mean...
- Well, not for you.

103
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,219
- No.
- 'Cause you've been busy.

104
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,466
- Right.
- With your career.

105
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:25,807
Sure, yeah,
my career has kept me super busy.

106
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,643
Anyway, I know you're just in town
for the boat show,

107
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,687
but seriously... make yourself at home.

108
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,397
I really don't want to impose.

109
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,733
If there's anything I can do
to help around here...

110
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,403
Mom, dad was supposed to take me driving
after school today,

111
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,406
but now he's gotta take trip
to his dumb-ass basketball game.

112
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:44,534
- It's the quarter-finals.
- You'll get a hard-on during the game.

113
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,871
Now I'll get a hard-on because
you made me think about it. Thanks a lot.

114
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:51,333
- I'll take you driving this weekend.
- I need to practice every day.

115
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,710
I'm the only senior
who still doesn't have a license.

116
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,045
It's embarrassing.

117
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,923
Well, I got the store,
and I already took the morning off,

118
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,925
so unless you know any other adults...

119
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,091
Can bojack take me?

120
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:01,885
- Huh?
- What?

121
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,678
- I mean, he is an adult.
- Uh...

122
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,597
Well, I mean, if it's okay with bojack.

123
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:08,433
You'd really be doing me a huge favor.

124
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,687
Well, I guess I could make some time...
Before the boat show.

125
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,568
Keep your eyes on the road
and hands on the wheel.

126
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,904
- Okay.
- And don't text and drive,

127
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,322
unless it's an emergency,

128
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:25,617
like you have a really funny thing
that you just have to text someone.

129
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,745
- Got it.
- So, let me ask you something. Tsk.

130
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,705
Do your parents really love each other,

131
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,958
or is it
a stay-together-for-the-kids situation?

132
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,835
What? Why would you ask me that?

133
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,795
I don't know. Just making conversation.

134
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:39,798
- Why do we keep passing the same house?
- No, I don't. Shut up.

135
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:42,884
You shut up. What's the story?
Cute guy live there? Girl you hate?

136
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,678
College kid that gives you Adderall?

137
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,304
Okay, fine.

138
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,348
That's Diego mendoza's house.

139
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:49,975
He's just this stupid guy.

140
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,853
He's in my calculus class,
and sometimes we'll do this thing

141
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,564
where he goes, "hey,"
and then I go, "hey."

142
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,941
Then he goes, "what's the homework?"
And I tell him.

143
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:01,486
It's not like a big deal or anything,
but it's like this thing we do.

144
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,363
- Cool thing.
- So, anyway...

145
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,575
My best friend, Alison f.
Was talking to Rachel kaplan.

146
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,501
[Bojack] Do ireally need
to know their names?

147
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,418
[Penny] Rachel heard from ray-ray
and the bean

148
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,372
that Diego said
if prom happened right now

149
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,624
he'd want to go with am sand/er,
and I'm like,

150
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,127
"yeah, pfft, okay, dude."
You know what I mean?

151
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,814
I don't know these people.
You know I don't know these people.

152
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:22,507
But then he said
since prom's not for another two months,

153
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,594
he could "foresee a situation"
where he would want to go with me,

154
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,847
because he knows I'm a real girl
who's mostly chill. [Chuckles]

155
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,892
If you're so mostly chill,
why do you keep driving by his house?

156
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,936
In case he comes out,
to, like, check the mail or something.

157
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,772
I'll get out of the car and be like,
"that's so funny.

158
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,190
I was just going for a drive."

159
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,943
And he'll be like, "oh, hey."
And I'll be like, "hey."

160
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,488
- 'Cause that's our thing, you know? Heh.
- That's the whole plan?

161
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,950
Well, it's better than your plan
for buying a boat in new Mexico.

162
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,537
Dude, what are you really doing here?

165
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:02,589
And I didn't know where else to go.

166
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,966
- Please do not tell your parents.
- Well, I won't,

167
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,593
but I think people are gonna notice

168
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,946
if you go to a boat show
and don't come back with a boat.

- Oh, my god. Oh!
- What are you doing?

172
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,852
- What happened to your plan?
- Oh! I panicked.

he'd be wearing a tank top. [Screams]

- Yeah, deal.

- They didn't even put me in.
- [Sighs] I'm sorry, sweetheart.

But you did some great
cheering from the bench,

you sweat a lot.

- Sure, they will.

- Who?

- The boat? It does not.
- Come on. You gotta give her a name.

193
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,240
You should call her the escape from la.

00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,118
That actually is a good name for it,
the nongendered object.

- Are you flirting with my boat right now?

So, I had another meeting today
with the drama chair at sfcc.

- Oh, that's cool. Congratulations.

to some pretty zany misadventures.

Mm. Brussels sprouts are delicious, mom.

sprouts, because I think they're terrible.

about the Brussels sprouts?

in show business.

- that Diego was gonna ask me to prom.
- Yeah?

- But he keeps not doing it.
- That is so typical Diego.

259
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:55,280
So, I thought, okay,
if he's not going to ask me, I'll ask him.

260

- Way to take initiative.
- Oh. Rookie mistake.

00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,825
So, I asked him and he said no.

262

And then this other girl Lyla k.
Came up to him and was just like, "hey."

263

And he was like, "hey."
And that's our thing.

out of school,

sounds like a real bust-ass super-skank.

What? Why?

275

Think about it. If you went with Diego,
you'd be nervous.

"Does he like me? Am I cool?"

277

But with me you can just relax
and enjoy yourself.

278
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,661
Diego will see you
have a good time without him,

279
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,246
and that'll make him superjealous.

280
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,832
So, he'll come up to you,
and he'll say, "hey."

281

- Rachel kaplan's gonna shit herself.

- How is that cold?
- Then he'll say, "wanna dance?"

285
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,760
And you'll say,
"I'm busy right now. Maybe later."

286
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:01,721
And then... never dance with him.

287

- Wait... I'm sorry.

[Opossum screeches]

324
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:44,490
- Ugh. It burns.
- Yeah, 'cause it's not a juice box.

325
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,867
You want some?

326
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,261
- No, thanks.
- [Coughing] Pussy.

327
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,285
I'm driving.

328
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,203
Well, more for me.

329
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,414
This prom is really bourgeois.

330
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:55,043
- Lyla k. Is so pretty.
- Shut up. She's got nothing on you.

331
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:58,838
Why is nobody dancing?
We gotta get this party started.

332

[Sighs]

333
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,007
Beat it, Poindexter.

334
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,054
- Poindexter?
- It's a nerd reference... [sighs]

335
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,217
- Just beat it.
- Ah!

336

- [Feedback squeaks]
- Huh?

337
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,488
- Hey!
- What's the big idea?

338
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:10,016
Why is there an adult
at our high-school prom?

339
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,226
All right, folks.
We're taking it back to 1991,

340
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:16,064
when a new funky-fresh dance craze
took this nation by storm.

341
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,790
- All right. [Chuckles]
- I'm listening.

342
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:20,360
As a teen, I'm open to new experiences.

343
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:24,530
Ready for the chorus, stay on the beat,
and here... we... go. Wokka wokka.

344
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,200
Now boys and girls,
if you wanna do the bojack,

345
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,494
- take your hands and put them on your...
- Boo!

346
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,537
- This sucks.
- This guy's bad.

347
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,104
Oh, no. God, no! This is not
the immediate praise I expected.

This prom sucks.

351
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,295
You can say that again.

352
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,423
- I know.
- [Slurring] My flask got empty.

353
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:46,010
Can we be back to the car,
so, for more get for put in it?

354
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,137
Or we could go back to the car
and just leave.

355
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:51,849
- You can't just leave the prom.
- Of course you can. You're young.

356
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,351
You can do whatever you want.

357
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:54,852
That's what they never tell you

358
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,355
until it's too late.
You don't have to be here.

359
00:14:57,522 --> 00:15:00,191
Yeah, he's right. Society is everywhere.

360
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:03,194
- Society.
- Well, what else are we gonna do?

361
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,655
I'd say it's time to get down,
time to hit the town.

362
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,366
Is that a lyric
from that "do the bojack" song?

363
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,451
Just get in the car.

Okay, one... two... three.

Hey, you wanna climb up
on the water tower?

369
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:33,933
We could see the whole city.

370
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,060
Yeah, I wanna go.

- Oh.

Oh, careful there, maddy.

I'm really glad we left that stupid prom,

we didn't get to dance.

who passed out like this,

in a hospital setting.

tell them we left the dance early,

Why?

It's one thing if a bunch of kids
get drunk on prom night,

410

you think?

the right thing
isn't always the best thing.

like a kid.

- Mm...

- Whoa, penny, come on.
- If you want to do it, I'm ready.

448
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,078
I have condoms in my room.
I can put one on with my mouth.

449
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,664
- With your mouth?
- I put one on a banana in health class.

450
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,208
With your mouth?
What kind of health class...?

451
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,711
Look, you are an amazing person,
but you're 17.

452
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,297
Which is the legal age of consent
in new Mexico.

453
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:52,548
Okay, that's not...

454
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,343
And I didn't drink tonight,
so everything's totally legal.

455
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,304
- Penny, no.
- It's okay. I want this.

No, you think you do, but...

457

You don't know what you want.

Hey.

00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,535
- What'd you do with my daughter?
- She had a big night.

464
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,538
She was falling asleep on the ride home.
Where are the boys?

465
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,916
Trip's at a friend's house
and Kyle's asleep.

466
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,337

- Hey, do you remember that time

467

you, me and herb let those balloons go
over studio city?

468
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:37,385
Oh, yeah. Didn't we attach glow sticks
to them or something?

469
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,820
- Yeah.
- Ooh. That was really bad

470
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:39,679
for the environment.

471
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,555

- on one of those balloons.
- But it's a nice memory, right?

473
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,227
It was a fun night.

474
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,354
We had a lot of fun nights.

475
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,732
Before you left town,
you told me L.A. was a tar pit.

476

- Do you remember?
- Oh, god.

477
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,445
I said so many things when I was young.
I thought I was so deep.

478
00:19:56,612 --> 00:20:00,449
- Well, do you still think it's true?
- Do I think la. Is a tar pit?

479
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,744
No, I think you're the tar pit.

480
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,414
- Me?
- No, not "you" you.

481
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,165
I'm just saying, like...

482
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,960
It doesn't matter where you are,
it's who you are,

483
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:13,754
and that's not gonna change
whether you're in California

484
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,966
or Maine or new Mexico.

485
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:19,427
You know, you can't escape... you.

00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,315
I keep... making these bad decisions.

490
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,527
- And hurting people.
- Well...

491
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:39,572
- Can I tell you a joke?
- Is it a long joke with no punch line?

492
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,031
- No.
- Then go ahead.

493
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:45,411
Guy goes into the doctor's office.
Says, "doctor, it hurts when I do this."

494
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,787
You know what the doctor says?

495
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,415
- "Don't do that."
- Yeah.

496
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,543
- That's actually... good advice.
- And you know what else?

497
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,421
The doctor in that story was a woman.

498
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:56,630
What?!

499
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,883
[Bojack laughs]

500
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,180
[Both moan]

501
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,556
[Charlotte gasps]

502
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:07,641
Oh. Bojack, um...

503
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,519
- I think you got the wrong idea.
- Let's go.

504
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,730
- Let's get out of here right now.
- No, bojack.

505
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:14,273
You and me, this is real.

506
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,734
- You know this is real.
- My husband is right upstairs.

507
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:19,487
I don't care about your husband.
All that matters is us.

508
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:22,323
- Don't do this, bojack.
- I know you feel it, too.

509
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,658
So many times in my life
I've done the wrong thing,

510
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:25,951
but this is the right thing,

511
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,329
and I have never been more sure
of anything.

512
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:30,581
I've wasted so much time sitting
on my hands

513
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:32,750
and imagining what could have been.

514
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:36,295
Tell me you don't feel the same.
Tell me you haven't thought about it.

515
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:38,506
[Charlotte sighs]

516
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,841
- I think you should go.
- Okay.

517
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:41,801
- Tomorrow.
- Charlotte...

518
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,553
I have worked very hard to build this life
for myself.

519
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,721
I am happy here.

520
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,432
And you just roll into my life
like a hurricane.

521
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:51,894
Why? Because we knew each other
for five minutes 30 years ago?

522
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,437
- I don't know you.
- You do.

523
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:55,689
I don't. And you don't know me.

524
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,526
No, please.
These last few months have been amazing.

525
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,611
- I love you, your family and this town.
- Stop.

526
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:02,446
- I never wanted to hurt...
- Bojackn

527
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:05,825
I'm sorry I kissed you. I shouldn't have.
We can pretend it didn't happen.

528
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,869
- Everything can go back to normal, but...
- No, no, stop. No.

529
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,455
Please, don't make me go back to la.

530
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:14,917
I don't care where you go, bojack,
but I can't have you around here.

531
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,670
You make me too sad.

532
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,339
Okay.

533
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,387
What are you doing here?

534
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:29,348
I know what I want, bojack.

535
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,562
Go to bed, penny.

536
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,699
[Sighing]

537
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,494
Wait, what?

538
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,334
[Clattering from inside]

539
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,795
[Penny whispering] Shh, shh, shh.
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

540
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,512
[Penny gasps]

541
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:09,513
- No.
- Mom.

542
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,348
- Charlotte.
- Penny, go to your room.

543
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,726
- We didn't even do anything.
- Now, penny.

544
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,605
[Penny crying]

545
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:21,150
- Charlotte, I am so sorry...
- Don't. Don't you dare.

546
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,654
If you are not out of my driveway
in 30 minutes, I will call the police.

547
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:29,783
And if you ever try to contact me
or my family again,

548
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,161
I will fucking kill you.

549
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,086
[Can crunches]

550
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,712
[Grunts]

551
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:32,888
[Diane] Hey.

552
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:34,556
Hey.

553
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,100
You're still here?

554
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:39,019
Yup, still here.

555
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:42,940
Back in the '90s

556
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:48,779
I was in a very famous TV show

557
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,491
-I'm bojack the horse -bojack!

558
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:57,913
Bojack the horse
don't act like you don't know

559
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:03,961
and I'm trying to hold onto my past

560
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:08,757
it's been so long
I don't think I'm gonna last

561
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:12,469
I guess I was trying
to make you understand

562
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:16,765
that I'm more horse than a man

563
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:21,478
or I'm more man than a horse

564
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,022
bojack!
