about "Birthday Dad" is the women

in the movie,

We could put together
a kind of low-key salon

and support each other.

I love the one where the boyfriend
is looking at the other lady.

328
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:40,648
And his girlfriend turns to him
with this expression of tremendous pain.

329
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,693
How could this man, who claims
to love her, betray her so flagrantly?

330
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,445
That is a very sad meme.

331
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,490
-Uh... okay. Bye, Pickle Pack!
-[phone beeps]

332
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,742
-What is going on?
-What do you mean?

333
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:52,826
You've been acting different.

334
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,954
I first noticed it the night
of the "Philbert" premiere,

335
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,456
when you came home late,
smelling like Diane,

336
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,500
and then after a while,
things went back to normal.

337
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,044
But then you got real weird again
right around that time

338
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,337
BoJack went to rehab.

339
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,466
Right before you proposed that day,
you also smelled like Diane. [sniffs]

340
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,093
-Oh, my God. I get what's happening.
-Pickles--

341
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,428
-You feel guilty.
-You're right.

342
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,556
-I feel so guilty because I chea--
-Because your good friend's in rehab.

343
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,018
Chiefly feel guilty because
my good friend's in rehab, like you said.

344
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,311
Why don't you go visit him,

345
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,438
if this is the thing
that's been weighing on you.

346
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,565
It is. The one thing.

347
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,362
-BoJack Horseman...
-[gasps]

348
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,948
-...and Mr. Peanutbutter in the same room?
-Oh, God, no.

349
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,533
-This can't be happening. Um...
-What is this?

350
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,368
Hello! Are you here
for the "Friends and Family Meeting"?

351
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:35,411
-No--
-You're the first friend

352
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,746
-that BoJack's invited.
-I don't even remember getting invited.

353
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,415
-I did not invite--
-I'm proud of you, BoJack.

354
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,125
-Hey, I'm Doctor Champ.
-Mr. Peanutbutter.

355
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,543
-[BoJack groans]
-Hey! Your name's Mister?

356
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,461
-My name's Doctor!
-How about that!

357
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,589
Wait, is Doctor Champ just your name?
Are you not a doctor?

358
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,174
Five-minute warning everyone.
Five minutes.

359
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,176
Come on, BoJack,
let's get some good seats!

360
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,553
-[chuckles]
-We're sitting in a circle.

361
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,346
They're all good seats.

362
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:59,560
How can I make up for all the lies,
the stealing, the cheating?

363
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:04,148
She says we can make a fresh start,
but is that even possible?

364
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,274
-Hmm...
-[indistinct chattering]

365
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,735
I'm sorry, can we go back to the cheating?
Did you tell her about that?

366
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,529
Oh, Mr. Peanutbutter, we don't interrupt
when others are sharing.

367
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,197
Just looking for a little context.

368
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,575
Why don't you go looking in your car?
Maybe you left it there.

369
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,827
BoJack, don't interrupt
Mr. Peanutbutter, he's sharing.

370
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,163
-No. But he--
-But, but, but. Butts are for cigarettes.

371
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,247
Thank you, Doctor Champ.

372
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,751
As I was saying, I think Doug
needs to be honest with his wife

373
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,044
before they can move forward.

374
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,796
-[all] Ah.
-You're right. I need to tell her.

375
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,215
But on the other hand,
maybe that's just your guilt talking.

376
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,885
Isn't it sometimes better to let
sleeping dogs lie?

377
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,344
I-I assume your fiancée is a dog?

378
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,305
She's my wife, and she's human.

379
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:40,100
Okay, so your fiancée.
Let's say her name is... Pickles.

380
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,226
-Wait, uh...
-She doesn't know,

381
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,519
and she's happy not knowing.

382
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,272
Wouldn't telling her now
just cause additional pain?

383
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:48,108
-[all] Uh-huh.
-So, it's better not to tell her?

384
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,153
Oh, well, that's really convenient
for you, Doug!

385
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,697
-No, I didn't--
-Hey, everyone, look at "Doug"

386
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,157
deciding that the best option

387
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,910
just happens to be the one
where he doesn't get in trouble!

388
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,746
-Mr. Peanutbutter--
-But that's just Doug all over, isn't it?

389
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:04,291
Classic, stupid, selfish,
inconsiderate Doug!

390
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,335
[indistinct chattering]

391
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,338
Wow. Those are harsh words.

392
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,674
But I needed to hear them. Thank you.

393
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,551
Uh...

394
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,389
[sighs]

395
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,183
Look, I don't know
what's going on with you,

396
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,103
although I'm pretty sure either you
or Doug cheated on Pickles.

397
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:28,649
But I understand that feeling of needing
to bottle up your guilt,

398
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:29,858
not burden other people with it.

399
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,361
-Yeah?
-You think you're protecting them

400
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:36,740
from your toxicity, you convince yourself
that you're being selfless, but...

401
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:41,120
it comes out in other ways
and it infects everything.

402
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,412
[sighs]

403
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,998
I could use a drink.
Is there a bar in here?

404
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,500
♪ Mr. Peanutbutter ♪

405
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:51,213
So, then I said, "No. It's rehab."
And then he left. That was two days ago.

406
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,882
Two days ago? Oh, my God, the gala!

407
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:57,010
Yeah, and you're probably worried
about your baby, too, right?

408
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,762
Oh, my God, my baby!

409
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,223
[line ringing]

410
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,684
Come on, Todd.
Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.

411
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:06,603
Hey! I was wondering if I'd hear
from you Todd-Day.

412
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:11,191
Yes-Todd-Day, I thought,
"Maybe I'll hear from her Todd-Morrow!"

413
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,235
Is Untitled Princess Carolyn Project okay?

414
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,195
-She sure is.
-Oh, thank God.

415
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,574
Wait, you're talking about
Untitled Princess Carolyn Project,

416
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,992
the baby, right?

417
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,743
Who else would I be talking about?

418
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,744
Well...

419
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,457
-Mr. Knickerbocker will see you now.
-Great!

420
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,542
[phone ringing]

421
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,668
Oh, hold on one second.

422
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:30,669
-[phone beeps]
-Hello?

423
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,462
Todd, I have to go to a photo shoot.

424
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,548
I need you to take the baby
for an hour or so.

425
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:39,136
Well, you know how much I love hanging out
with Untitled Princess Carolyn Project,

426
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,429
but I can't Todd-Day

427
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,264
-because of all these meetings I have.
-[snores]

428
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,893
But if my schedule weren't so busy,
I'd say...

429
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:48,645
-[pops]
-"Sure, I'd be happy to."

430
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,190
-Great. I'll see you at VIM in 15 minutes.
-[baby crying]

431
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,442
-Um... okay?
-[phone beeps]

432
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,361
I'll be right back.
[pants] Sorry about that.

433
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,447
[phone rings]

434
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,990
-Hello?
-Todd, change of plans.

435
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,701
Bring the baby over to me
at SmashFox Studios.

436
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:06,788
Okay, he had to cancel another meeting
but he will see you now.

437
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,790
-I'll be right back.
-[baby cries]

438
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,584
I'm going to level with you, Todd.

439
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:14,254
You making me wait made me angry,
and that made me respect you.

440
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:17,257
Sorry, things have just been a little
hectic since I've been helping out

441
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,384
with Untitled Princess Carolyn Project.

442
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,638
"Untitled Princess Carolyn Project"?
I'm intrigued.

443
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:26,558
-You think the project has legs?
-Yeah, she has legs.

444
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,477
I'm thrilled to meet you.

445
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,980
The whole town is buzzing
about "Untitled Princess Carolyn Project."

446
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,857
Weird, but okay.

447
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,234
We need something big.

448
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,777
Is "Untitled Princess Carolyn Project"

449
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,528
the kind of thing
that makes a lot of noise?

450
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:39,696
She sure does!

451
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,198
I'm in. Name your price.

452
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,574
Um...

453
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,076
Jonathan?

454
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,995
We took a big swing
with Dick Wolf's Milwaukee shows.

455
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,873
Turns out audiences are not interested
in a whole night of Milwaukee,

456
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,625
so now we've got some slots to fill.

457
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,419
Do you think
"Untitled Princess Carolyn Project"

458
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,088
could live for several seasons?

459
00:20:56,171 --> 00:21:00,217
I don't see how those things are related,
but I certainly hope so!

460
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,427
-Well, how can I help?
-You wanna help?

461
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,763
Let's start with a two-season pick up.

462
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:08,642
Yeah, sure, pick-up, drop-off,
whatever works best for you.

463
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,352
-That would be great.
-Great!

464
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,687
[baby giggles]

465
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,356
Well, here she is.
What time do you want me to pick her up?

466
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,275
Wait, it's a baby?

467
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:19,027
-And she has legs!
-[coos]

468
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,571
I already canceled
"Milwaukee Waste Management."

469
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,241
I told the shareholders
this was gonna save the network!

470
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,702
-We designed the poster!
-[coos]

471
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:30,330
Todd, we need a show. We can't air a baby!

472
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,373
[blows raspberry]

473
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,876
So, long story short,
Pinky canceled the baby,

474
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,586
but now we owe him a TV show.

475
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,046
Huh?

476
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:42,134
So, the show is called "Birthday Dad."

477
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:47,347
The pilot was directed by Flea Daniels,
and the show will be run by Karen Kitada.

478
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:50,517
The creator of "Med School Nights"?
And "Med School Nights: The New Class,

479
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,102
Med School Nights Goes to Law School"?

480
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,645
-Uh...
-This show's about a dad

481
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,105
who died on his birthday,

482
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:58,275
and every episode,
his spirit visits a different

483
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:01,320
intersectionally representative person
on their birthday

484
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,530
to help them work
through their own issues.

485
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:06,950
But how are all these characters related?
When does the show take place?

486
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,452
How does Birthday Dad die?

487
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,787
Those are mysteries we'll tease
all season!

488
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,582
-Uh-huh.
-"Birthday Dad," you'll laugh, you'll cry,

489
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,584
-you'll Birthday Dad!
-What do you think?

490
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,296
Yeah, like I said, we'll take anything.

491
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,176
[phone ringing, beeps]

492
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,552
-Yeah?
-[BoJack] Hey.

493
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,180
Um, so, I don't wanna waste any more
of your time.

494
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:30,515
I just wanted to say that I know
you're really busy

495
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:35,479
and I'm sorry for making your life
more difficult this week and also always.

496
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:39,358
Also, I know that my apologies
are pretty much meaningless at this point,

497
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,609
and I'm sorry for that, too.

498
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,696
Why didn't you tell me
about the "Friends and Family Meetings"?

499
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,449
I don't know. You got so much goin' on,
I didn't wanna bother you.

500
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,159
I would have come.

501
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,080
Okay. Thank you.

502
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,082
[elevator dings]

503
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,044
[pants] Did I miss it?
Is the "Do It All Ball" all done?

504
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,922
Yes. We did it all.
Good of you to show up, by the way.

505
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:05,092
Oh, yeah? Well, it's good of you to, uh...

506
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,760
Shut up!

507
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,054
[sighs]

508
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,349
Are you okay?
You're not your usual medium-clever self.

509
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,518
Can I ask you something?

510
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:18,897
So, there's work, right?
I mean, work makes sense to me.

511
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,065
And I'm good at it.

512
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:25,195
I don't feel that way about my baby.

513
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:29,574
I don't think
I'm feeling what I'm supposed to feel.

514
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,326
What I thought I would feel.

515
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,995
I mean, I love her, of course I do.

516
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,624
Of course I love my daughter.
But... [sighs]

517
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:42,546
But I don't know if I love her.

518
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:45,841
I know I'm a terrible person
for even thinking it,

519
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:49,469
but... what if it never happens?

520
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:54,516
Do you love all your clients' projects?

521
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,726
-Of course.
-No, you don't.

522
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,645
But you take care of them
and you keep them alive

523
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,814
-because that's your job, right?
-Yeah.

524
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,441
So, now you've got a new job.

525
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:05,735
And it is a ruthless one,
and I mean ruthless.

526
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,738
You don't have time to waste
second-guessing how you feel about it.

527
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,241
You just have to do it
the best that you can,

528
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,951
and know that that's the best you can do.

529
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:17,664
You know,
[scoffs] we have so much in common.

530
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:20,792
I don't know why we've spent
so many years hating each other.

531
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,003
I never hated you. Did you hate me?

532
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,921
Uh... no.

533
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:28,216
[cries]

534
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,053
Hey. [shushes] Hey. Please. Listen.

535
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,723
-Did you get the Fijis for the Fugees?
-[giggling]

536
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,225
Yeah. Is that silly?

537
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:41,062
The Fugees were egregious
when they got interviewed by Regis.

538
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,315
[both giggling]

539
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,109
Isn't that right...

540
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,987
-Ruthie?
-[blows raspberry]

541
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,324
[mellow music playing]
