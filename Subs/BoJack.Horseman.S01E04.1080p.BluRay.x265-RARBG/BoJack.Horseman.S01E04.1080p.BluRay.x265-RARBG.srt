00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,316
Um, actually, no.

175
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,276
Todd clearly thinks
the world of you.

176
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,111
Todd thinks the world
of pop-tarts.

177
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,156
Look, I get that helping other
people is not your thing, but...

178
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,575
What? I let Todd live
rent-free in my stately manse.

179
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,494
I am his own personal
Mother Teresa.

180
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,663
But do you let him stay here
because you're kind

181
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,709
or just because you're terrified
of being alone?

182
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,583
[Laughing] That is insane!

183
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,087
I would love to be alone.
That is all I want.

184
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,089
Mmm... if that were really true,

185
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,192
I don't think you'd be clipping
Todd's wings all the time.

186
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,592
What? That's unbelievable.

187
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,843
Todd!

188
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,345
What? Clean up my shit?

189
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:53,473
Yes, but also,
I would like to...

190
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,433
Help you with your
dumb-ass rock opera.

191
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,270
- What?
- I am... supporting you.

192
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,232
I-I don't understand.
Oh, my god, are you dying?

193
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:06,236
No. I... think you have great
depth of untapped potential

194
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:09,489
and I wish to mentor you
in your... art.

195
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,241
- Really?
- Yes.

196
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,702
Wait, is this going to be
like that time

197
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,268
you promised to take me
ice skating,

198
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,168
and I got really excited
about the ice skating,

199
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,308
but then instead of ice skating,
you left me at home

200
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,612
so you could go
to the strip club

201
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,794
and then you took the strippers
ice skating?

202
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,046
- No.
- Then hooray!

203
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,884
Let's dig in. Where to start?

204
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,928
Okay, well, the headline is,
I hate it.

205
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,513
I hate everything about it.

206
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,600
The premise is bad
and the execution is also bad.

207
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,642
It's an irredeemable jumble
of shit.

208
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:38,893
Tough but fair.

209
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,145
Ahem.

210
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,063
That said, I don't see why

211
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,982
we can't make something
really great here.

212
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,526
Okay, thank you.
I'll work on that.

213
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,070
[Panting] Are you close?

214
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,322
- How 'bout now?
- No!

215
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:52,657
Now?

216
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:53,984
You're not even inside of me.

217
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,411
Oh, god!

218
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,203
Did you get there?

219
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,329
[Door opening]

220
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,166
Okay, so you know
in the second act closer

221
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,835
when the seekers of newtopia
are in the turbidians' dungeon

222
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,003
and they learn their ship

223
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,629
- has been destroyed?
- No.

224
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,507
Well, what if we move that
to the fourth act?

225
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:10,943
I have no idea
what you're talking about,

226
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,302
but that idea is terrible.

227
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,387
I hear the note.
Let me see what I can do.

228
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,473
[Playing keyboard]

229
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,143
J“ and that's why this planet j“

230
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:25,273
j“ su-u-u-u-u-cks j“

231
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,776
how can I put this?

232
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,944
Imagine if the holocaust
happened

233
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,113
every four years
like the Olympics.

234
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,408
I would rather that happened
than your rock opera.

235
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,660
That's not really a note.

236
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,622
In fact, none of your notes
have been notes.

237
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:42,290
I feel like you're
not even listening.

238
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,143
Yeah, well, you know what?
Maybe I would listen

239
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:45,835
if the turbidians
had some reason

240
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,462
to enter
the cave of swollen dreams

241
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,440
that didn't break the pact
they made in act one

242
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:50,882
with queen darneesa.

243
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,133
You have been listening.

244
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,426
Just doesn't make sense.

245
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,095
The turbidians
are a loyal people.

246
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,430
They... they wouldn't
betray their queen.

247
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,933
Unless...

248
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,061
[Both] They were working
for queen darneesa,

249
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,563
who gave them a potion
that would counteract

250
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,690
the effects of
the elixir of failed remembrance

251
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,417
so they could bring
the secret knowledge

252
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,570
from the cave back to her,
and then establish newtopia

253
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,365
as a vassal state
to the craterman kingdom!

254
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,493
Well, don't just sit there!
Get this down!

255
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,204
[Grunting] Oh, you like that.

256
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,831
You like daddy's good stuff?

257
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,082
Not especially.

258
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,792
[Groans]

259
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,086
Did you get there?

260
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:32,465
Okay, what if there isn't
a robot army?

261
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,135
I think you just
blew this thing wide open.

262
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,471
[Playing keyboard]

263
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:42,851
J“ we'll make this
our newtopia-a-a j“

264
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,578
- j“ up a fifth j“
- [high note] J” ah j”

265
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:45,645
j“ down a fifth j“

266
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,273
[low note] J“ a-a-ah j“

267
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,316
that was great!
This train is moving.

268
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,152
[Laughs] Let's take a break
and get lunch.

269
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,696
Wait, you want
to get lunch with me?

270
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,156
Yeah, that's right.

271
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,575
Is this like the time
you invited me to lunch,

272
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,785
but then, when I got
to the restaurant,

273
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:03,121
you texted me to tell me
you weren't coming

274
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:07,458
because you were at a strip club
"eating stripper" for lunch,

275
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,502
and also, it was my birthday?

276
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,630
Then hooray!

277
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:18,303
And that was a last time
I worked with David 0. Russell.

278
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,888
What's that old expression?

279
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:23,183
"Fool me once, shame on me,
but fool me twice...

280
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,475
Fiddle-Dee-Dee."

281
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,644
I do believe
that is the expression.

282
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:27,830
- [Phone ringing]
- Ooh, hold on.

283
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:28,854
I gotta take this.

284
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,231
Erica, I don't have time

285
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,650
to be charmed to death
right now.

286
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,445
So how long have you been
dating Mr. Peanutbutter?

287
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,947
Is it serious?
I'm only asking for the article.

288
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,594
Better question:
How long does it take

289
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:40,867
to write a buzzfeed article?

290
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,285
I want to be thorough.

291
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,537
What? Diane, Diane,
Diane, Diane!

292
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,372
- Do you know what today is?
- Sunday?

293
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:50,585
It's "burritos as big as your head"
day at El taco loco!

294
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,045
We gotta go right now!

295
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,647
I thought we were going to see
the Diane arbus show

296
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,673
at lacma today.
You know I love Diane arbus.

297
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,551
[Chuckles]
I see what's happening here.

298
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:02,805
Her name is Diane,
and your name is Diane.

299
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,224
That's not what's happening.

300
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,701
I can go to the arbus show
with you, Diane.

301
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,101
What?

302
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,828
I've actually been meaning
to go myself.

303
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,855
Oh, man, you guys
are perfect for each other.

304
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,690
Why did you ever break up?

305
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,067
[Nervous laugh]

306
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,152
Okay, less yakking,
more snacking.

307
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:19,906
Let's go ride in the car!
[Barking]

308
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,324
Here's your steak.

309
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:24,202
- Uh, sorry.
- Mm-hmm.

310
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,621
You mean to tell me
that for a full year

311
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,468
you were on the run
from the Russian mafia?

312
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,000
Well, a Russian mafia.

313
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,062
I can't believe you never
told me any of this stuff.

314
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,647
I just thought you were
a dumb freeloader

315
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:36,523
who ate all my food
and played video games all day.

316
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,591
You should have seen me
in high school.

317
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,301
There was this one game,
decapathon.

318
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,928
I remember that game.

319
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,264
I was up for Dr. Decapitator
in the movie version.

320
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,866
They said they wanted
someone hipper,

321
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,493
but the part ended up
going to Robert downey.

322
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:48,935
- Junior?
- If it was junior,

323
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,603
I would have said, "junior."

324
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,439
That game basically
destroyed my life.

325
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,775
I flunked out of school,
my girlfriend left me.

326
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,610
I mean, I didn't stop playing

327
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,488
until my mom
threw me out of the house.

328
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,533
I mean, that's when
I first realized, you know,

329
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,034
I'm a total screw-up.

330
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,953
You're not a screw-up
anymore, Todd.

331
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,831
You're about to have
a hit rock opera on your hands.

332
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,083
I'm really glad you think that.

333
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,710
I got Princess Carolyn to invite

334
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,087
Virgil Van cleef
to our next rehearsal.

335
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,714
Who in the what Van?

336
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,758
Virgil Van cleef is
the biggest name in rock opera.

337
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,927
Okay, think of all
the great rock operas

338
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:25,430
from the last 20 years.

339
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:26,763
Okay.

340
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,725
He had a piece of all of them.

341
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,768
Wow, Todd, are you sure
we're ready for that?

342
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,645
Hey, you said yourself
the train is moving,

343
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,188
but if you think

but also, be careful,

Right now, it's set
mostly in space,

387

In fact, he never even
graduated high school,

389

[Slams keys]

515
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,301
Ugh!

J“ loam j“

517
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,804
enough!

518
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,139
Clearly, Van cleef has shown

519
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,725
a rare lapse in taste
and judgment.

520
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:29,145
I apologize for wasting your
time with this talentless imp.

521
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,897
Hey, Van cleef,
Todd may not be ready

522
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,275
for the high-flying world
of rock opera

523
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:37,236
or the larger world
outside of my living room couch,

524
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,947
but you know what?
He's a good friend.

525
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:41,866
I don't see how that's relevant.

526
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,326
No, of course you don't.
Maybe Todd's worse off today,

527
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,953
but you're worse off
in the long run,

528
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,997
because you're gonna die
alone and unloved,

529
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:49,915
you pompous, affected asshole!

530
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,836
[Grunts] Mon dieu!
Never have I ever!

531
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:56,088
Hey, maybe don't
burn the bridge.

532
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,048
I could still beg
for a second chance.

533
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,759
Shut your mouth, Todd.

534
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,470
And you shut yours, Van cleef,
or I will buck it shut.

535
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,514
Suck a dick, dumb shits!
[Blows raspberry]

536
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:10,644
Oh, that damn video game.

537
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,813
No, it's not
the video game's fault.

538
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,273
I blew it.

539
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,567
For a second,
I actually convinced myself

540
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:19,111
I was more than
just a worthless screw-up.

541
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:23,657
Fool me once, fool me twice,
fool me chicken soup with rice.

542
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,343
I guess there's a reason
they don't call it

543
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,577
"the rock opera fun."

544
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,954
They call it
"the rock opera business."

545
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,664
[Sighs] Guess I won't be needing

546
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,291
this piece ofjunk anymore.

547
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,710
Hey, no. Hold on to that.

548
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,396
Why don't you just put it
in the living room closet?

549
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,631
- Really?
- In fact, from now on,

550
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,734
you can keep all your stuff
in the living room closet.

551
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:43,552
Thanks, bojack, for everything.

552
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,472
This, I will get rid of.

- Don't look at those!

554
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,062
- Those are private!
- Are these the notes

00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,772
you've been taking
on Mr. Peanutbutter?

556
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,190
It's gibberish!

557
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:58,818
Have you just been mashing keys
this whole time?

558
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,304
It's a... it's a work
in progress.

559
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,571
What's really going on here?

560
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,824
Look, I've been following
you two around

561
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,271
for the last couple weeks,
and I think it's pretty obvious

562
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:09,703
to everyone that you shouldn't
be with Mr. Peanutbutter.

563
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,288
You should be with me.

564
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,207
No, I've dated you.

565
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:17,169
Sure, you're smart
and sophisticated and cool,

566
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,838
but you're also mean.

567
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,340
What's your article
on Mr. Peanutbutter called?

568
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,676
The working title is,
"nine jokes from the '90s

569
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,123
we haven't stopped laughing at."

570
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:26,762
- I knew it!
- Come on!

571
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:29,139
Like you're not gonna
tear bojack apart in your book.

572
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,600
I'm not "tearing him apart."

573
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,895
I'm writing a nuanced portrait
of a complicated man.

574
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,606
Well, then, we might be
doing different things.

575
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,942
Mr. Peanutbutter is nice to me!

576
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:43,612
He's kind and he's generous
and he's loyal.

You know what your problem is?
You're trying to be a Zelda

578
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,159
but you're so obviously a Zoe.

579
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:51,370
Ugh! Don't label me.
You don't know who I am.

580
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:54,999
You can live your happy Zelda
life in this happy Zelda town

581
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,293
and pretend you're
a happy Zelda,

582
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:01,463
but I know you,
and this isn't you.

583
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,757
People don't change, Diane,
not really.

584
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,301
Mr. Peanutbutter's a Zelda.

585
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,927
He's happy and he's carefree

586
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:10,806
and he's loving,
but you and me, we 're zoes.

587
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:14,143
Yeah, I bought this earlier,
and I'd like to return it.

00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,710
I don't know where
the receipt went.

589
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:17,980
I remember you.
You came in yesterday.

590
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:20,316
No problem.

about what we did here, bojack.

I don't know
what you're talking about.

but someday soon,
that darkness is gonna come out,

601
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:49,720

I want you to call me.
