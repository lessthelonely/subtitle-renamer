1
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:13,639
And he says... he says,
"why the long face?"

2
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:18,227
And I say, “hey, buddy,
I can't help it."

3
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,938
You get that? Long face.
Horses have long faces.

4
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,482
I am a horse, my face is long.
You get it, right?

5
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:25,108
Good, good.

6
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,503
What about
the rock Hudson stuff?

7
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:27,587
Felt like that flew
over your heads.

8
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:28,611
Did you get that?

9
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,507
Keep this up, and the only
thing we're gonna get

10
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:31,615
is our money back!

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,660
Okay, okay,
it wasn't that funny.

12
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,870
Maybe you didn't get it.

13
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,517
Uh, hey, guys, guys...

14
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:45,754
Hey, let me buy you a drink.

15
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:47,422
Get cancer, jerk wad.

16
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,424
You've got some good material,
you really do.

17
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,009
The gorbachev stuff,
it's killer.

18
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:54,054
But you gotta stop asking people
if they get things.

19
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,847
But then who do I know
if they got it?

20
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,266
They'll laugh.

21
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:00,227
Why are you giving me advice?

22
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,521
Look, I've been doing stand-up
for a year now,

23
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:05,357
and it's the responsibility
of big shots like me

24
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:07,734
to always be looking out
for the little guy.

25
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:08,986
Let me buy you a drink.

26
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,362
Oh, I don't drink.

27
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:11,822
Bojack horseman.

28
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:13,740
H e rb kazazz.

29
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,911
Oh, god!

30
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,664
Goddamn it, Todd,
clean up your shit.

31
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:22,082
What am I supposed to do, okay?

32
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,875
You don't give me
any closet space.

33
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:25,482
Not my problem.
A better man than you

34
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,004
once said, and I quote,

35
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,050
"it's the responsibility
of little guys like you

36
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,882
to be looking out
for big shots like me."

37
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,634
Who said that?

38
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,928
I don't know, Jesus, ghandi,
Malcolm-Jamal Warner.

39
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,973
Clean up your shit! Oh!

40
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,449
Gloria steinem,
one of the leading lights

41
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:39,076
of modern feminism.

42
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,995
You will surely go down
in the annals of history

43
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,747
just as surely
as Lisa lampanelli

44
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,875
will go down in the locker room
of the Houston rockets.

45
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,546
Hey, bojack, settle a bet.

46
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,340
Are you a Zoe or a Zelda?

47
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:54,591
Don't know what that means.

48
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:55,918
Well, I was talking to Wayne.

49
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,678
- Who's Wayne?
- I'm Wayne.

50
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,138
Wayne's writing an article
about me for buzzfeed.

51
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,933
Buzzfeed?
What'll they think of next?

52
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,936
Fun fact: Wayne is also
my ex-boyfriend.

53
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,229
Ha! You're funny.

54
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:08,916
Pretty cool, eh, bojack?

55
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,565
Diane's writing a book
about you,

56
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,401
Wayne's writing
an article about me.

57
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:13,902
We're the same!

58
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,669
How could you think that
that's the same?

59
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,698
My book will be in libraries
for hundreds of years.

60
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,449
Your buzzfeed article
will be crammed

61
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,827
between an animated gif
of a cat falling asleep

62
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,954
and a list of fun facts
about legally blonde.

63
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:25,580
Ha! Classic Zoe.

64
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,416
I still don't know
what that means.

65
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,060
Well, are you familiar
with Mr. Peanutbutter's house?

66
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,378
Do you mean his sitcom
that coincidentally

67
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,839
had the exact same premise
as my sitcom?

68
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,800
Not the exact same.
Mr. Peanutbutter's house

69
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:39,094
featured a pair of twins,
Zoe and Zelda.

70
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:41,930
Zelda was the sunny,
fun-loving extrovert.

71
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:44,266
Look at my pumpkin,
Mr. Peanutbutter.

72
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:45,809
Pretty smile, zelly-belly.

73
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:46,976
Aww...

74
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,271
Whereas Zoe was the smart,
cynical introvert.

75
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:51,314
My pumpkin's throwing up
because Halloween

76
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,692
encourages excessive consumption
of refined sugar

77
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:56,361
at a time when obesity rates
are sky high.

78
00:03:56,528 --> 00:04:00,323
Plus, Halloween costumes are
a gateway to casual racism.

79
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,576
Why don't I keep the knife,
zo-Bo?

80
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:03,743
J“ who's that dog? J“

81
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,245
j“ Mr. Peanutbutter j“

82
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,289
j“ knick-knack, paddywhack
give a dog a bone j“

83
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,207
now, was the show's acting
ham-fisted

84
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,625
and the writing moronic?

85
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,210
N-N-No?

86
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,589
Yes, but the zoe/zelda
paradigm rang true.

87
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:18,091
I believe everyone's
either a Zoe or a Zelda.

88
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:22,262
For example, Nixon was a Zoe
and Kennedy, a Zelda.

89
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:25,348
Al Gore, Zoe.
George w. Bush, total Zelda.

90
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,935
It's r2-dz and c-3po,
zooey and Emily deschanel.

91
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,353
So zooey's a Zoe?

92
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,148
No, zooey's a Zelda.
Emily's the Zoe.

93
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:34,566
What a crazy world.

94
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,067
So which one are you, bojack?

95
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,320
I think I'm... above this.

96
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:39,863
Said the Zoe.

97
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,783
Well, I think I'm a Zelda.

98
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,576
Or maybe you're
the third kind of person,

99
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,983
whose only function is to drain
the energy and life force

100
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,163
from his host organism.

101
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,831
Come on, bojack.

102
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,678
Nah, he's right.
I'm pretty much worthless.

103
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,673
See? You say something
to someone enough times,

104
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,545
and eventually,
he internalizes it.

105
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,963
The system works.

106
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,216
I don't have a job,
I don't have any prospects.

107
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,469
I probably won't ever finish
the rock opera I'm working on.

108
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:03,845
What?

109
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:07,224
Since when are you
working on a rock opera?

110
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,059
Oh, no. Why'd I ask that?

111
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:12,270
Basically, it's Tommy
by way of cirque du soleil

112
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,065
set in space,
with heavy erotic overtones,

113
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,150
and the gripping psychodrama
of a thriller

114
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,487
with plenty of heart
and more than a little humor.

115
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:24,157
I call it
newtopia rising, book I:

116
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,576
The search for a new utopia.

117
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:27,994
Bookl?

118
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,913
You've got me
thinking sequel here.

119
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,295
J“ traveling on a spaceship j”

120
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,547
- I'm in.
- I'm out.

121
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:42,259
J“ so far away from home j“

122
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:46,179
j” to find a new
and better place j“

123
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,641
j“ a planet rich with loam j“

124
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,768
loam? "Rich with loam?"

125
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,186
Yeah, it's a kind of soil.

126
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,313
These people are simple,
agricultural types.

127
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,940
On a spaceship?

128
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:03,113
J“ we learned a lot
and had some laughs I

129
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,448
j“ but they couldn't
make us slaves j“

130
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,118
j“ no! No, they couldn't
make us slaves I

131
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:09,369
J“ no! I

132
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,289
j“ no, they could-n-n-n't j“

133
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:16,042
J“ make u-u-u-us j“

134
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,296
J“ one, two j“

135
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,298
"slaves." just say "slaves."

136
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:27,262
J“ sla-a-a-a-a-a-aves j"

137
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,101
That was... and I don't
say this lightly...

138
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,020
Worse than a hundred
September 11ths.

139
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,689
Yeah, you're right.
This was stupid.

140
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,190
I don't know
what I was thinking.

141
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,942
Well, guess I'll give up
forever.

142
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,360
That's the spirit.

143
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,158
Now, you have to understand
that as a port city,

144
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:51,953
liverpool had unique access to
all aspects of American culture,

145
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,040
especially blues music and its
unruly nephew, rock and roll.

146
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,101
I thought this story was about
running into Paul McCartney

147
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,752
in the bathroom
at the golden globes.

148
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,796
It is. I thought you would
appreciate some context.

149
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,423
Let's skip that one
for a minute.

150
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,674
Tell me about Todd.

151
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,426
Todd? What's to tell?

152
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,654
Five years ago, he found his way
into one of my house parties

153
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,930
and never left.

154
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,265
And you've never asked him
anything about himself?

155
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,493
I've asked him to get a job,
I've asked him to move out.

156
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,644
With a little encouragement,

157
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,228
I'll bet he could
really flourish.

158
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,915
I mean, didn't you have anyone
who helped you

159
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,041
when you were just starting out?

160
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,316
Um, actually, no.

161
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,276
Todd clearly thinks
the world of you.

162
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,111
Todd thinks the world
of pop-tarts.

163
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,156
Look, I get that helping other
people is not your thing, but...

164
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,575
What? I let Todd live
rent-free in my stately manse.

165
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,494
I am his own personal
Mother Teresa.

166
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,663
But do you let him stay here
because you're kind

167
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,709
or just because you're terrified
of being alone?

168
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,583
That is insane!

169
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,087
I would love to be alone.
That is all I want.

170
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,089
Mmm... if that were really true,

171
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,192
I don't think you'd be clipping
Todd's wings all the time.

172
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,592
What? That's unbelievable.

173
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,843
Todd!

174
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,345
What? Clean up my shit?

175
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:53,473
Yes, but also,
I would like to...

176
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,433
Help you with your
dumb-ass rock opera.

177
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,270
- What?
- I am... supporting you.

178
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,232
I-I don't understand.
Oh, my god, are you dying?

179
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:06,236
No. I... think you have great
depth of untapped potential

180
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:09,489
and I wish to mentor you
in your... art.

181
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,241
- Really?
- Yes.

182
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,702
Wait, is this going to be
like that time

183
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,268
you promised to take me
ice skating,

184
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,168
and I got really excited
about the ice skating,

185
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,308
but then instead of ice skating,
you left me at home

186
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,612
so you could go
to the strip club

187
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,794
and then you took the strippers
ice skating?

188
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,046
- No.
- Then hooray!

189
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,884
Let's dig in. Where to start?

190
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,928
Okay, well, the headline is,
I hate it.

191
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,513
I hate everything about it.

192
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,600
The premise is bad
and the execution is also bad.

193
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,642
It's an irredeemable jumble
of shit.

194
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:38,893
Tough but fair.

195
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,145
Ahem.

196
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,063
That said, I don't see why

197
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,982
we can't make something
really great here.

198
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,526
Okay, thank you.
I'll work on that.

199
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,070
Are you close?

200
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,322
- How 'bout now?
- No!

201
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:52,657
Now?

202
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:53,984
You're not even inside of me.

203
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,411
Oh, god!

204
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,203
Did you get there?

205
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,166
Okay, so you know
in the second act closer

206
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,835
when the seekers of newtopia
are in the turbidians' dungeon

207
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,003
and they learn their ship

208
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,629
- has been destroyed?
- No.

209
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,507
Well, what if we move that
to the fourth act?

210
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:10,943
I have no idea
what you're talking about,

211
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,302
but that idea is terrible.

212
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,387
I hear the note.
Let me see what I can do.

213
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,143
J“ and that's why this planet j“

214
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:25,273
j“ su-u-u-u-u-cks j“

215
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,776
how can I put this?

216
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,944
Imagine if the holocaust
happened

217
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,113
every four years
like the Olympics.

218
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,408
I would rather that happened
than your rock opera.

219
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,660
That's not really a note.

220
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,622
In fact, none of your notes
have been notes.

221
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:42,290
I feel like you're
not even listening.

222
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,143
Yeah, well, you know what?
Maybe I would listen

223
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:45,835
if the turbidians
had some reason

224
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,462
to enter
the cave of swollen dreams

225
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,440
that didn't break the pact
they made in act one

226
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:50,882
with queen darneesa.

227
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,133
You have been listening.

228
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,426
Just doesn't make sense.

229
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,095
The turbidians
are a loyal people.

230
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,430
They... they wouldn't
betray their queen.

231
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,933
Unless...

232
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,061
They were working
for queen darneesa,

233
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,563
who gave them a potion
that would counteract

234
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,690
the effects of
the elixir of failed remembrance

235
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,417
so they could bring
the secret knowledge

236
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,570
from the cave back to her,
and then establish newtopia

237
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,365
as a vassal state
to the craterman kingdom!

238
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,493
Well, don't just sit there!
Get this down!

239
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,204
Oh, you like that.

240
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,831
You like daddy's good stuff?

241
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,082
Not especially.

242
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,086
Did you get there?

243
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:32,465
Okay, what if there isn't
a robot army?

244
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,135
I think you just
blew this thing wide open.

245
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:42,851
J“ we'll make this
our newtopia-a-a j“

246
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,578
- j“ up a fifth j“ - J” ah j”

247
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:45,645
j“ down a fifth j“

248
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,273
J“ a-a-ah j“

249
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,316
that was great!
This train is moving.

250
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,152
Let's take a break
and get lunch.

251
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,696
Wait, you want
to get lunch with me?

252
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,156
Yeah, that's right.

253
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,575
Is this like the time
you invited me to lunch,

254
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,785
but then, when I got
to the restaurant,

255
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:03,121
you texted me to tell me
you weren't coming

256
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:07,458
because you were at a strip club
"eating stripper" for lunch,

257
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,502
and also, it was my birthday?

258
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,630
Then hooray!

259
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:18,303
And that was a last time
I worked with David 0. Russell.

260
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,888
What's that old expression?

261
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:23,183
"Fool me once, shame on me,
but fool me twice...

262
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,475
Fiddle-Dee-Dee."

263
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,644
I do believe
that is the expression.

264
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:27,830
Ooh, hold on.

265
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:28,854
I gotta take this.

266
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,231
Erica, I don't have time

267
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,650
to be charmed to death
right now.

268
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,445
So how long have you been
dating Mr. Peanutbutter?

269
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,947
Is it serious?
I'm only asking for the article.

270
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,594
Better question:
How long does it take

271
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:40,867
to write a buzzfeed article?

272
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,285
I want to be thorough.

273
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,537
What? Diane, Diane,
Diane, Diane!

274
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,372
- Do you know what today is?
- Sunday?

275
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:50,585
It's "burritos as big as your head"
day at El taco loco!

276
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,045
We gotta go right now!

277
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,647
I thought we were going to see
the Diane arbus show

278
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,673
at lacma today.
You know I love Diane arbus.

279
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,551
I see what's happening here.

280
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:02,805
Her name is Diane,
and your name is Diane.

281
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,224
That's not what's happening.

282
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,701
I can go to the arbus show
with you, Diane.

283
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,101
What?

284
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,828
I've actually been meaning
to go myself.

285
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,855
Oh, man, you guys
are perfect for each other.

286
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,690
Why did you ever break up?

287
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,152
Okay, less yakking,
more snacking.

288
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:19,906
Let's go ride in the car!

289
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,324
Here's your steak.

290
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:24,202
- Uh, sorry.
- Mm-hmm.

291
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,621
You mean to tell me
that for a full year

292
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,468
you were on the run
from the Russian mafia?

293
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,000
Well, a Russian mafia.

294
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,062
I can't believe you never
told me any of this stuff.

295
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,647
I just thought you were
a dumb freeloader

296
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:36,523
who ate all my food
and played video games all day.

297
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,591
You should have seen me
in high school.

298
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,301
There was this one game,
decapathon.

299
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,928
I remember that game.

300
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,264
I was up for Dr. Decapitator
in the movie version.

301
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,866
They said they wanted
someone hipper,

302
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,493
but the part ended up
going to Robert downey.

303
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:48,935
- Junior?
- If it was junior,

304
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,603
I would have said, "junior."

305
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,439
That game basically
destroyed my life.

306
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,775
I flunked out of school,
my girlfriend left me.

307
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,610
I mean, I didn't stop playing

308
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,488
until my mom
threw me out of the house.

309
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,533
I mean, that's when
I first realized, you know,

310
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,034
I'm a total screw-up.

311
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,953
You're not a screw-up
anymore, Todd.

312
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,831
You're about to have
a hit rock opera on your hands.

313
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,083
I'm really glad you think that.

314
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,710
I got Princess Carolyn to invite

315
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,087
Virgil Van cleef
to our next rehearsal.

316
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,714
Who in the what Van?

317
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,758
Virgil Van cleef is
the biggest name in rock opera.

318
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,927
Okay, think of all
the great rock operas

319
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:25,430
from the last 20 years.

320
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:26,763
Okay.

321
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,725
He had a piece of all of them.

322
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,768
Wow, Todd, are you sure
we're ready for that?

323
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,645
Hey, you said yourself
the train is moving,

324
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,188
but if you think
we're not ready,

325
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,416
I mean, I'll listen to you.

326
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,066
Hey, you've done
enough listening, buddy.

327
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,985
Maybe it's about time
I start listening.

328
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,504
Well, I feel like...

329
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,654
Gotta take this. Hello?

330
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,948
Hello? Bojack horseman?

331
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,034
We have some very delicate
pictures you might

332
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,453
have an interest in not getting
into the wrong hands.

333
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:49,954
I am very happy with my current

334
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:51,706
long distance provider,
thank you.

335
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:52,873
What?

336
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,418
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm having lunch with my friend.

337
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,503
But if you just listen...

338
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,425
All right, gang, when Virgil Van
cleef gets here, look alive.

339
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,260
This could be Todd's big break,

340
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,804
so clap really hard
and laugh at all the jokes,

341
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,851
even if they're not funny,
but also, be careful,

342
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,784
because a lot of things
you might think are jokes

343
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,269
are not jokes,
so, you know, look out.

344
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,458
- That was not a joke.
- That was not a real laugh.

345
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:19,202
I hope you don't mind
I brought Wayne along.

346
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,902
- Who's Wayne?
- I'm Wayne.

347
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:22,755
I just wanted to make sure
he had everything he needs

348
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,114
for the big buzzfeed
cover story.

349
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,116
Buzzfeed is a website.
There is no cover.

350
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,534
Eh, "tomato," "tomato."

351
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,786
It's "tomato," "to-mah-to."

352
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,329
You say, "tomato," "to-mah-to,"

353
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:32,955
I say, "tomato," "tomato."

354
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,250
Oh, hey, Diane,
I got you something.

355
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,127
Oh, plane tickets?

356
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,004
Yep, to San Francisco.

357
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,090
That's where the arbus exhibit
is heading next.

358
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:45,176
Oh, my god.
Thanks, Mr. Peanutbutter.

359
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:51,391
Gentlemen, dazzle me.

360
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,726
What you're about to see
is rough, very rough.

361
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,312
It's a vomit pass at what
might become a rock opera.

362
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:57,748
Right now, it's set
mostly in space,

363
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,023
but we're not married to that.

364
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,692
Todd is neither a singer
nor a trained musician.

365
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,545
In fact, he never even
graduated high school,

366
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,029
he told me in confidence.

367
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,281
Keep all that in mind
as you give it up for Todd.

368
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,996
Okay, so we start in 1887

369
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,499
with a young Emma Goldman.

370
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:24,257
J“ no they couldn-n-n-n't
make u-u-u-us j“

371
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:29,137
j“ sla-a-a-a-a-aves j“

372
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,724
it needs
a third act showstopper.

373
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,101
I had the same note.

374
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:38,062
But in all, it's spellbinding.

375
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:39,229
All right!

376
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,355
Whoo!

377
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,234
You know, I run a small
theater in north Hollywood.

378
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:46,279
We were supposed to mount
a j.C. Superstar revival

379
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,990
next month, but of course,
Andrew Lloyd Webber has to be

380
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,200
a real hot penis
about everything.

381
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:54,036
Oh, Andy.
Fool me once, shame on you,

382
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,496
but teach a man to fool me,

383
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,999
and I'll be fooled
for the rest of my life.

384
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:01,252
Anyway, could this show
be ready to debut in six weeks?

385
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:04,797
Six weeks? Uh, damn.
Yeah, I guess so.

386
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,593
Marvelous! We'll schedule
an investor showcase posthaste.

387
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,720
In the meantime, libations!

388
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,014
Ah!

389
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,765
- Popping, what?
- This is great.

390
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,952
You know, just when you think
you have a person pegged,

391
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,061
he can still find ways
to surprise you.

392
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,397
Yeah, Todd really Rose
to the occasion, didn't he?

393
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:22,857
I was talking about you.

394
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,442
Ah, well, it was nothing.

395
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:27,028
Maybe the Zoe has
a little Zelda in him after all.

396
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:28,404
I appreciate the sentiment,

397
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,051
but I still think
that game is stupid.

398
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,241
Hey, bojack, do you realize
what this means?

399
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,453
I mean, if this thing's a hit,
I could finally move out.

400
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,872
Oh, uh, you're gonna move out?

401
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,249
You won't have to yell,
"hey, Todd, clean up your shit!"

402
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,044
Or, "Todd, why haven't you
cleaned up your shit yet?"

403
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:46,047
Or, "Todd, what was the name of
that guy from perfect strangers?

404
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:48,674
Not Bronson pinchot,
but the other one?"

405
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,886
Good, that's great.
That's great and good.

406
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,013
So good, so great.

407
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,058
- Just great, and also good.
- Mm-hmm.

408
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,399
And as you can see,
progress has been swift.

409
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,068
For tomorrow's
investor showcase,

410
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:10,404
we'll have choreography
and pyrotechnics for you.

411
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,281
This is all just
happening so fast.

412
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,534
I don't... I don't think
Todd is ready for this.

413
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,827
Todd's not ready
or you're not ready?

414
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,080
Don't make this about me.
I've seen what happens

415
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:21,874
when baby birds get pushed
out of the nest too soon.

416
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,918
It's not your fault.

417
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:26,712
I thought he was ready.
He seemed ready.

418
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:30,633
It's not... your... fault.

419
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,343
You're right.
In these heady times,

420
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,054
what Todd needs is an agent.
Ha! Ha!

421
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,014
- I just need you to deliver...
- Hoo! Ha!

422
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,183
- That third act showstopper...
- Ha!

423
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,435
And then we'll be
fully financed!

424
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,605
Todd can do it!
Todd can do anything!

425
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:45,999
- Can I get your autograph?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

426
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,108
And another autograph,

427
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,795
and initial here, here,
here, and here.

428
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,170
- Right here?
- And the last four digits

429
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,612
- of your social.
- Okay.

430
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:55,408
So I think the big
third act number Virgil wants

431
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:56,784
might be a big anthem that...

432
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,578
Whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy, buddy,

433
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,824
I'm not gonna let you start
on this until we stock up

434
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,290
on snacks and red bull.

435
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:06,127
I do get snacky.
You think of everything.

436
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,631
'Scuse me, young man.

437
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,883
Can you hand me
that Ronnie milsap cassingle

438
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,343
in the 10-cent bin?

439
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,971
Sure thing, lady.

440
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:20,933
Oh, my god. Decapathon vii?

441
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,019
This just came out.

442
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,729
Todd, put it down.

443
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,314
Is this really only a dime?

444
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,357
If it's in there,
that's the price.

445
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,943
Todd, this is no time
for a relapse.

446
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,529
Look, okay, I'll buy it now,
but I won't play it

447
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,740
till after I've written
the new song.

448
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,950
Todd, this is a bad idea!

449
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,286
- Whoa!
- All sales are final.

450
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,041
Okay, let's see here.

451
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,376
I wonder if it still
smells the same.

452
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,703
I assure you, it still smells

453
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,147
like cheap plastic
and child labor.

454
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:53,299
Okay, here we go. Song time.

455
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,869
Or should I just play
one game now,

456
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,055
just to get
the creative juices flowing?

457
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,033
We both know that if you
play that game tonight,

458
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,725
you'll never leave this couch!

459
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,852
Ah, no, you're right, of course.

460
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:08,272
- Thank you.
- Good night.

461
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,194
Come on, decapathon, come on.

462
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:16,238
Oh, come on, decapathon.

463
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,532
Oh.

464
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,702
Wake up! It's the morning!

465
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,164
Damn it, Todd, the investor
showcase is in half an hour.

466
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,957
- Did you work on the song?
- Huh?

467
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,293
Pull yourself together, man!

468
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,922
Ugh! Why did the water
have to come out of your mouth?

469
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,801
Well, I'm awfully sorry
to have wasted your time.

470
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:39,345
I don't think our man
is going to show.

471
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,056
Wait!

472
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:43,823
Good god, what's happened?

473
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,171
He looks like he was
up all night

474
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,937
playing some sort of
videographic game.

475
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,980
He's in no condition
to debut a song.

476
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,608
Give the kid a chance,
Van cleef.

477
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,617
J“ loam, loam, loam j”

478
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:06,163
j“ and a...
Uh, little room to, uh, roam j“

479
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:10,626
j“ and on this planet
it's our home j“

480
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,962
j“ in space j“

481
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:16,424
rock opera?
More like "schlock flop-era."

482
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,301
Ugh!

483
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,553
J“ loam j“

484
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,804
enough!

485
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,139
Clearly, Van cleef has shown

486
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,725
a rare lapse in taste
and judgment.

487
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:29,145
I apologize for wasting your
time with this talentless imp.

488
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,897
Hey, Van cleef,
Todd may not be ready

489
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,275
for the high-flying world
of rock opera

490
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:37,236
or the larger world
outside of my living room couch,

491
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,947
but you know what?
He's a good friend.

492
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:41,866
I don't see how that's relevant.

493
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,326
No, of course you don't.
Maybe Todd's worse off today,

494
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,953
but you're worse off
in the long run,

495
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,997
because you're gonna die
alone and unloved,

496
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:49,915
you pompous, affected asshole!

497
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,836
Mon dieu! Never have I ever!

498
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:56,088
Hey, maybe don't
burn the bridge.

499
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,048
I could still beg
for a second chance.

500
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,759
Shut your mouth, Todd.

501
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,470
And you shut yours, Van cleef,
or I will buck it shut.

502
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,514
Suck a dick, dumb shits!

503
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:10,644
Oh, that damn video game.

504
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,813
No, it's not
the video game's fault.

505
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,273
I blew it.

506
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,567
For a second,
I actually convinced myself

507
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:19,111
I was more than
just a worthless screw-up.

508
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:23,657
Fool me once, fool me twice,
fool me chicken soup with rice.

509
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,343
I guess there's a reason
they don't call it

510
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,577
"the rock opera fun."

511
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,954
They call it
"the rock opera business."

512
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,664
Guess I won't be needing

513
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,291
this piece ofjunk anymore.

514
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,710
Hey, no. Hold on to that.

515
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,396
Why don't you just put it
in the living room closet?

516
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,631
- Really?
- In fact, from now on,

517
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,734
you can keep all your stuff
in the living room closet.

518
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:43,552
Thanks, bojack, for everything.

519
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,472
This, I will get rid of.

520
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,958
- What the...
- Don't look at those!

521
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,062
- Those are private!
- Are these the notes

522
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,772
you've been taking
on Mr. Peanutbutter?

523
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,190
It's gibberish!

524
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:58,818
Have you just been mashing keys
this whole time?

525
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,304
It's a... it's a work
in progress.

526
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,571
What's really going on here?

527
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,824
Look, I've been following
you two around

528
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,271
for the last couple weeks,
and I think it's pretty obvious

529
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:09,703
to everyone that you shouldn't
be with Mr. Peanutbutter.

530
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,288
You should be with me.

531
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,207
No, I've dated you.

532
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:17,169
Sure, you're smart
and sophisticated and cool,

533
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,838
but you're also mean.

534
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,340
What's your article
on Mr. Peanutbutter called?

535
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,676
The working title is,
"nine jokes from the '90s

536
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,123
we haven't stopped laughing at."

537
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:26,762
- I knew it!
- Come on!

538
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:29,139
Like you're not gonna
tear bojack apart in your book.

539
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,600
I'm not "tearing him apart."

540
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,895
I'm writing a nuanced portrait
of a complicated man.

541
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,606
Well, then, we might be
doing different things.

542
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,942
Mr. Peanutbutter is nice to me!

543
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:43,612
He's kind and he's generous
and he's loyal.

544
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,740
You know what your problem is?
You're trying to be a Zelda

545
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,159
but you're so obviously a Zoe.

546
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:51,370
Ugh! Don't label me.
You don't know who I am.

547
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:54,999
You can live your happy Zelda
life in this happy Zelda town

548
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,293
and pretend you're
a happy Zelda,

549
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:01,463
but I know you,
and this isn't you.

550
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,757
People don't change, Diane,
not really.

551
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,301
Mr. Peanutbutter's a Zelda.

552
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,927
He's happy and he's carefree

553
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:10,806
and he's loving,
but you and me, we 're zoes.

554
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:14,143
Yeah, I bought this earlier,
and I'd like to return it.

555
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,710
I don't know where
the receipt went.

556
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:17,980
I remember you.
You came in yesterday.

557
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:20,316
No problem.

558
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,192
We're zoes, Diane.

559
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:25,112
We 're cynical and we 're sad
and we 're mean.

560
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,615
Thanks for your help,
character actress

561
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,325
margo martindale.

562
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:32,286
I don't feel good
about what we did here, bojack.

563
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:33,996
I don't know
what you're talking about.

564
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:36,790
This never happened.

565
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:39,752
There's a darkness inside you,

566
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,422
and you can Bury it deep
in burritos as big as your head,

567
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:46,258
but someday soon,
that darkness is gonna come out,

568
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:49,720
and when it does,
I want you to call me.

569
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,433
I like that guy.

570
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,519
Ahh.

571
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,249
J“ back in the '90s j”

572
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:24,505
j“ I was in a very famous TV show j“

573
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,550

574
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:29,969
j“ bojack the horse j”

575
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,972
j“ don't act like you don't know I

576
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:39,853
j“ and I'm trying to hold on to my past j“

577
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,271
j“ it's been so long j“

578
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:44,858
j“ I don't think I'm gonna last j“

579
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,235
j“ I guess I'll just try j“

580
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,404
j“ and make you understand j“

581
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:52,783
j“ that I'm more horse than a man j“

582
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:56,912
j“ or I'm more man than a horse j“

583
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,372
j“ bojack j“

584
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:02,793
boxer versus raptor.
