for this show,

and look at this...

with that?

7
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:20,979
Maybe it's
a different secretariat.

8
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,065
Ha ha ha ha. No,
but seriously, folks,

9
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:26,026
there is no truth
to these allegations.

10
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,529
I have never bet on
horse racing,

11
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,948
and I certainly did not bet on
my own races.

gonna give your show

I got sad.

and that seemed to make sense,

39
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,512
so then I just kept running.

40

Bojack, you you get sad,
you run straight ahead

41

no matter what.

don't you ever look behind you.

poop in a bucket.

170
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,875
Maybe I do. Maybe
I want to poop in a bucket.

171
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,419
If you want to poop in a
bucket, we can get you a bucket.

172
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,626
You don't have to go all the way
the chechnylavakia.

173
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:44,923
Am I saying that right?

174
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,800
It's not just
the pooping in a bucket.

175
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,887
I think it might be good for me
to get out of la.

176
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,637
For a little bit.

177
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,949
Sweetie, you know I support
you, whatever you want to do,

178
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,867
but you're not gonna find
what you're looking for

179
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,768
in these awful made-up places.

180
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:59,688
The universe
is a cruel, uncaring void.

181
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,107
The key to being happy
isn't a search for meaning.

182
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:05,318
It's to just keep yourself busy
with unimportant nonsense,

183
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,445
and eventually, you'll be dead.

184
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:11,116
Well, I guess
I can keep my options open.

185
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,282
Great.

186
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,452
[Whistles gleefully]

187
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,163
Hey, can I ask you something?

188
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,917
Did Vincent seem extra weird
to you last night?

189
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,712
Well, he's still three kids
in a trench coat, so, no.

190
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,256
We're going through a rough
patch. It's hard, you know.

191
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,383
He's works a fulltime job
at the business factory,

192
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,884
so when he gets home,

193
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,095
he just wants to unwind
by watching r-rated movies.

194
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,502
Ahh, I thought I was ready
for a real adult relationship,

195
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:35,807
- but...
- [Snores]

196
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:38,435
Enough about me.
Bojack, you are on fire.

197
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,478
Oh, are we talking
about me again?

198
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,981
We have an offer on the table
for you to play the bad guy

199
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,441
in the new James Bond.

200
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,776
- Ehh.
- I agree. Total garbage.

201
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,487
But this, it's a new drama
from the Coen brothers.

202
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,032
A western about a one-horse town
and you're the horse.

203
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,534
Hello, Oscar. What do you think?

204
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,911
I think now's the time
to finally make "secretariat."

205
00:08:57,078 --> 00:09:00,415
Really? Now? Aren't you
a little, um, very too old?

206
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,601
You asked me what I wanted
to do. That's what I want.

207
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,836
That's all I've ever wanted,
and if I can't get it now,

208
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,172
then all of this
has been for nothing.

209
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:08,882
Oh, fish. Of course!

210
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,800
Why would you ever
make things easy for me

211
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,511
when instead you could make
things incredibly difficult?

212
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,638
Laura, clear out
the rest of my day.

213
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,515
I have to push a Boulder
up a hill,

214
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,809
and then have it roll over me
time and time again

215
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,811
with no regard
for my well-being.

216
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:22,978
Attagirl.

217
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:27,192
All right, Todd. Pb livin'
needs a new project.

218
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:30,570
Bi-monthly curated box of snacks
has been an enormous success,

219
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,947
but I got into this game
to make movies,

220
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,574
so let's make a movie.

221
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,409
Well, I got a stack
of great scripts here.

222
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,179
Any one of them
would make a wonderful movie.

223
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:39,662
Fantastic.

224
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:43,792
But I also have this other
non-movie-related idea.

225
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,293
Ooh, let's hear the other idea.

226
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,045
Okay. I was
heading down Wilshire,

227
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:50,173
and I saw this empty
store front, and I thought,

228
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,175
"you know what
this world needs?"

229
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:53,843
Edge of my seat over here.

230
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,555
A store where people can buy
Halloween stuff.

231
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,433
Halloween store.
Feel like that's been done.

232
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,352
Yeah, in October,

233
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,897
but how come your never see
a Halloween store in January?

234
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,191
- It's an untapped market.
- Yeah.

235
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,568
A Halloween store
that's open year round.

236
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,071
- No, no. Just January.
- Brilliant.

237
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:16,157
That's the kind of idea
that wins golden globes.

238
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,121
I actually think the time
is right for "secretariat,"

239
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,414
so what do you want to play,
like, secretariat's dad

240
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,167
or his grandfather, maybe like
an elderly witch doctor

241
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,169
who puts a curse on him
or something?

242
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,421
Lenny, look, I know
I'm a little long in the tooth,

243
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,215
but I think that you
more than anyone

244
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,592
would know
not to count out an old pro.

245
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,427
Don't play the ageism card
with me, kid.

246
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,914
I've laid farts that lasted
longer than your entire career.

247
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:42,100
But secretariat was dead at 27,
so who we kidding here?

248
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,147
Just set the project up
and give me an audition.

249
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:45,562
- That's all I ask.
- All right.

250
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,127
You got yourself
a "go" picture, kid.

251
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,065
And by you, I mean me.
And by "go" picture,

252
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,432
I mean I'll make some phone
calls and see what I can do.

253
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,654
And by kid,
I mean middle-aged adult.

254
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,778
[Whispers] Shh. No, no, no.
Put it here. Put it here.

255
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,994
- [Whispers] Okay, I'll do it.
- Ahem.

256
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:04,289
- Has this ever happened to you?
- Has what ever happened to me?

257
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:07,333
- Todd?
- Yes, Mr. Peanutbutter?

258
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,340
What's going on?
Why are you talking like that?

259
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,296
Todd, I just got
a phenomenal idea

260
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,006
for a Halloween costume.

261
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,276
Why don't you and I dash over
to the store right quick

262
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,510
and spend some hard-earned
American money?

263
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,471
Oh, but, Mr. Peanutbutter,
didn't you hear?

264
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,474
It's January, and
the Halloween store won't open

265
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,102
for another nine months.

266
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,563
But I want satisfaction now.

267
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,940
Has this ever happened to you?

268
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,984
Not to anyone ever at any time.

269
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:36,738
Ahem. We give you
Halloween in January,

270
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:39,866
a truly immersive
Halloween experience

271
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,993
for the rest of us.

272
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,704
Halloween in January?
Please elaborate.

273
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,956
Okay, but before I do,
tell the audience.

274
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,292
- Have we ever met before?
- Never.

275
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:53,046
Well, according to facts,
there's more suicides in January

276
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,632
- than any other month.
- I'm getting pretty close over here.

277
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:59,719
Also, there's less
Halloween stores. Coincidence?

278
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:03,348
Wow, I'm convinced.
This store could save lives.

279
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,225
Unbelievable.
When your powers combine...

280
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,811
You are somehow even more stupid
than the sum of your stupids.

281
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,605
- Thank you.
- Go on.

282
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:13,066
You stop encouraging him
and you stop encouraging him.

283
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,859
The two of you
are playing with fire.

284
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,153
A fire called
having a good idea.

285
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,906
Or maybe
a fire called friendship.

286
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,825
- Fires aren't called things.
- What about the Chicago fire?

287
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,202
Or fire island.

288
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:25,954
- Or Gabe.
- Who's Gabe?

289
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,914
Just a fire I met once.
Named him Gabe.

290
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,916
- He sounds delightful.
- He was. Good guy.

291
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,542
[Groans]

292
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,759
Business, business, business.
Is that all you ever think about?

293
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,052
I don't know.

294
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,054
What's under that coat, Vincent?

295
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,765
- You need to let me in.
- Not right now.

296
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,642
I have to call
the guy at the office

297
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,686
and take the car to the place.

298
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,479
It's always guys in places
with you.

299
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,731
You know, I thought
I wanted to date a real adult,

300
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,817
but I'm actually young at heart.

301
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,152
I need to feel the grass
between my toes.

302
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,697
I want to wear jeans.
I want to dance.

303
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,907
- That's baby stuff.
- No, Vincent.

304
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:05,618
There's more to being an adult
than just work and business

305
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,705
and the tall-person rides at
Disneyland. I want to have fun.

306
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,791
There has to be a difference
between monogamy and monotony.

307
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,210
What's mahumanunny?

308
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,212
Well, clearly we had
a different understanding

309
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,214
of what this was.

310
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:21,175
I'd like to be an adult about
this, but frankly, I'm hurt.

311
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,887
I think you should just go,
just git. Get out of my life.

312
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,556
Okay.

313
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,141
Okay.

314
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:31,269
Could I have another soda?

315
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:37,233
Bojack, you know
Kelsey jannings, our director.

316
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,485
I really appreciate you
giving me this opportunity.

317
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,029
Yeah.

318
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,781
Secretariat
was kind of my hero as a kid.

319
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,783
Yeah, he was
a lot of people's hero.

320
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,661
Well, you know, here was a guy
who had everything...

321
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,747
Yeah, I know the story.
I'm the director.

322
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,665
Kelsey, be nice.

323
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,852
She's just cranky because
she's already seen 30 people

324
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:57,545
read for this today,
and we are all so goddamn sick

325
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,756
of seeing auditions,
so whenever you're ready.

326
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,132
Justjump right in.

327
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:03,259
Great. Let's get to it.

328
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,553
[Stilted] Hey,
ain't you that horse

329
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,222
- that won all them races?
- Not today, ma'am.

330
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:11,642
Today I'm just a customer
who wants a warm slice of pie.

331
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,478
Can I ask you a question?

332
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,480
When you're out there
on that there racetrack,

333

00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,945
Either you know what you want,
and you don't get what you want,

500
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,388
or get what you want, and then
you don't know what you want.

501
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:07,141
- Well, that's stupid.
- Yeah.

502
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:09,327
I don't know if this makes you
more or less excited,

503
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,896
but I actually decided to take
a job on the secretariat movie

504
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,939
as a character consultant.

505
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,859
Wow, so we're gonna be
working together again.

506
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,861
Yeah. I hope
you don't get sick of me.

507
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:20,654
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

508
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,324
- Is it weird I took this job?
- Why would it be weird?

509
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:25,785
You literally wrote the book
on secretariat.

510
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:29,497
Yeah, I know. I just...
When I first moved to la...

511
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,458
I thought I was gonna be doing
really important work.

512
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,794
You know, writing stuff
that makes a difference.

513
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,005
But then you kind of fall into
one thing and then another...

514
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:40,257
Well, you've got time.
There's always later, right?

515
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,218
Yeah, I guess
there's always later.

516
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,345
Do you remember
the last time I saw you?

517
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:47,139
You asked me if I thought you
were a good person deep down.

518
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,017
Do I remember that?
Yeah, vaguely.

519
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:52,561
You caught me off guard.
I didn't know what to say.

520
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:56,565
Well, do you think
I'm a good person... deep down?

521
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,193
That's the thing. I don't
think I believe in deep down.

522
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,696
I kind of think all you are
is just the things that you do.

523
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,825
- Well, that's depressing.
- [Laughs]

524
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,660
For what it's worth,

525
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,578
I think your writing
does make a difference.

526
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,121
Thanks.

527
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,541
I really wanted you
to like me, Diane.

528
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,417
I know.

529
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:32,560

I got so distracted
by trying to get tickets

539
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,235
to the new kids on the block
concert,

540
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,946
I completely lost sight
of what's important.

541
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,949
And I got so swept up in
my campaign for class president,

542
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,869
I forgot why I was running
in the first place.

543
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:33,871
And I was boy crazy.

544
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:35,998
Kids, kids,
I don't need a present.

545
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,208

right here.
