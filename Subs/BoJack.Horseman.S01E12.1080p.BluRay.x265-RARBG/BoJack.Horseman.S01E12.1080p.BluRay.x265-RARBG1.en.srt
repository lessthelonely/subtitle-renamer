1
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:08,342
When we booked you
for this show,

2
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:11,803
you'd just won the triple crown,
but then just this week,

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,515
I open up the newspaper,
and look at this...

4
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:17,059
“Secretariat
under investigation."

5
00:00:17,226 --> 00:00:18,894
What am I supposed to do
with that?

6
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:20,979
Maybe it's
a different secretariat.

7
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,065
Ha ha ha ha. No,
but seriously, folks,

8
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:26,026
there is no truth
to these allegations.

9
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,529
I have never bet on
horse racing,

10
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,948
and I certainly did not bet on
my own races.

11
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,194
Although I did bet the network's
gonna give your show

12
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:34,451
back to Joey bishop.

13
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,245
O... ho ho... Kay.

14
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:39,122
We get letters here on the show,
and one particular letter,

15
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:42,376
for you, actually, struck
a chord with our producers.

16
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,462
This is from bojack h.
Bojack is nine years old.

17
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,714
Bojack writes,
“dear secretariat,

18
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,758
“I am a horse just like you.

19
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:52,302
I like to watch racing,
and you are my favorite racer."

20
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,845
Smart kid.

21
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,732
"When I grow up,
I want to be just like you,

22
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,432
"and I think
I'm on the right track.

23
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:00,352
"Get it? Track,
because horses run on tracks,

24
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:02,062
“and you are a horse,
and I am a horse.

25
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:04,565
Do you get it? Do you
get my joke about the track?"

26
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,567
Okay, there's
a whole page of this.

27
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,533
Should I write him back
and tell him I get it?

28
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,529
He goes on,
"my question for you is,

29
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:12,531
"I am a good kid,
and I like to play,

30
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:15,867
"and I like to go to school,
but sometimes I get sad.

31
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,703
"What do you do
when you get sad?

32
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,414
How do you not be sad?
Sincerely, bojack.“

33
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,165
that's a great letter.

34
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,460
Bojack, when I was your age,
I got sad.

35
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,087
A lot.

36
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,756
I didn't come from
such a great home,

37
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:33,260
but one day, I started running,
and that seemed to make sense,

38
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,512
so then I just kept running.

39
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:39,266
Bojack, you you get sad,
you run straight ahead

40
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,685
and you keep running forward,
no matter what.

41
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,478
There are people in your life

42
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,582
who are gonna try and
hold you back, slow you down,

43
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,357
but you don't let them.

44
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,335
Don't you stop running and
don't you ever look behind you.

45
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,528
There's nothing for you
behind you.

46
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:54,615
All that exists is what's ahead.

47
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,702
Good morning, louisville.
It's August 22nd, 1973.

48
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,121
A sad day
for the sport of horse racing.

49
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:04,416
Secretariat banned for life
from competition.

50
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:07,336
It's a disgrace is what it is.
This is the '70s.

51
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,421
You can't cheat in sports
and get away with it.

52
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:11,506
You know, I think it
just goes to show you,

53
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,925
you can be the fastest runner
in the world,

54
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:17,929
but you can't outrun the truth.

55
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:22,059
And traffic is jammed today
coming into louisville.

56
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,478
Looks like some idiot
parked his car on the bridge.

57
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:24,121
And the golden globe
for best comedy or musical

58
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,708
goes to bojack horseman,
my friend,

59
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,210
for his book "one trick pony."

60
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,879
This is a first win
for bojack horseman

61
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,846
and his first appearance
at the globe ceremony

62
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:37,342
since his forced removal in 1992

63
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:40,679
after he exchanged blows
with sir Paul McCartney.

64
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,472
Wow, what an honor.

65
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,474
I have to thank
the hollywoo foreign press.

66
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,976
I feel like I should mention

67
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,853
that my book
was not a comedy or a musical.

68
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,872
Do you guys actually watch
the movies you give awards to?

69
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,523
'Cause I kind of
get the sense that...

70
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,668
Also, my book was not a movie.
You do know that, right?

71
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,360
We're friends.

72
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,647
Anyway, the response to this
book has been incredible.

73
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,323
These last three months
have been really amazing.

74
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,926
You know, a lot of people
said to me,

75
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,577
"you sure you want to
publish this book?

76
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,287
It's pretty personal."

77
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,473
And I said, "if I can make
just one person out there

78
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,000
feel a little less alone,
then it's all worth it."

79
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,252
And they said,
"that's really brave."

80
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,921
And I said, "well, I'm not one
to call myself brave,

81
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,090
but since you said it,
yeah, I am."

82
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,218
After-party at my restaurant!

83
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,904
Why did I say after-party
at my restaurant?

84
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,764
I do not want to throw a party.

85
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,349
It did seem unlike you. I'm
gonna go get some cotton candy.

86
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,602
- You want some?
- No.

87
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:32,105
- Yes.
- There he is, man of the hour.

88
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,399
- Hello, other grown up.
- Uch.

89
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:37,110
Oh, cheer up, dummy.
Your book is a huge success.

90
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,780
Everybody loves you.
You just won a golden globe.

91
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,448
If you can't be happy tonight,

92
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,533
maybe you'll
never be happy again.

93
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,344
I'm sorry, is that
supposed to be encouraging?

94
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,621
- Because it's super-bleak.
- Vincent adultman...

95
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,956
How are things
at the old nine to five?

96
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,292
Good. I went to
the stock market today.

97
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,960
I did a business.

98
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,837
I keep telling him
he works too hard.

99
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,298
Come on, Vincent, let's get away
from the rat race.

100
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,510
Take a cruise some place
wet and Latin.

101
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,804
I mean, can you imagine
this body in a swimsuit?

102
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,223
- I literally cannot.
- Vincent, let's do a lap.

103
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,766
Have you met Brendan Fraser?

104
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,768
I feel like you two
would love each other.

105
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,144
Whoa. Easy, easy.

106
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,979
I got to hand it to Diane.

107
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,273
This book has been everything
she said it would be.

108
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,150
Yeah, she knows
what she's doing.

109
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,985
How is Diane? I haven't
seen her since...

110
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,196
Well, I haven't seen her
in a while.

111
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,240
Oh, well, the book's
been huge for her, too.

112
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,325
She's practically as famous
as I am now.

113
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,852
- We're like the brangelinas.
- Well, I'm happy she's happy.

114
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,539
- And how are you?
- Well, it's been really hard...

115
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:34,042
Erica, is that you? Who
let you out of the burn ward?

116
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,127
- Get over here, you.
- Uhh.

117
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,798
Excuse me. I just have to tell
you how much I love your book.

118
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:43,343
It's so naked and honest
and revealing.

119
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,845
It is? Uh-oh.

120
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,691
I love the part about
how you became famous

121
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,890
so you could be constantly
surrounded by distraction

122
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,851
and wouldn't have to be
alone with yourself.

123
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,937
I thought that was
a really profound observation.

124
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,437
Oh, yeah, definitely.
So profound.

125
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,404
- Hey, do you want to get out of here?
- What?

126
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,125
Come back to my place,
maybe get a little more naked,

127
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:01,528
- honest and revealing?
- Oh, no. No, thanks.

128
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,405
- What about you?
- Yeah, okay.

129
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,287
Oh... whoa.

130
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,163
Huh.

131
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,042
- Hey, Diane.
- You still friends with bojack?

132
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,711
Heard you two were on the outs.

133
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,358
You gonna write another book
about it?

134
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,006
Oh, you looking at some oranges?

135
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,052
You gonna write a book
about those oranges, huh?

136
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,636
- Hello.
- Diane.

137
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,346
Sebastian St. Claire here,

138
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,599
famed billionaire
philanthropistladventurer.

139
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,684
Please, hold your applause.

140
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,103
- Okay.
- You can applaud a little.

141
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,022
Okay.

142
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,232
I got your number
from pinky penguin.

143
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,359
I'm looking for a journalist
to follow me around

144
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,862
for a few months
and document my daring exploits

145
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,990
aiding ravaged communities
and displaced people.

146
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:50,285
- Ssss.
- Wow, that sounds amazing.

147
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:53,580
But that's not usually
the kind of thing I write about.

148
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:58,043
Diane, if you can make people
care about bojack horseman,

149
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:01,171
surely you can make them
care about emaciated orphans

150
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:02,672
with missing limbs.

151
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,175
We need to wake people up.

152
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:06,968
Well, I am a morning person.

153
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,137
I hope you mean mourning
with a "u,"

154
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:12,474
because, Diane,
this is deadly serious.

155
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,184
Oh, yes, of course.

156
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,105
You want to spend
three months in Sudan?

157
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,524
Not just there. We're also
going to Haiti and Thailand

158
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,652
and Uganda and chechnya.

159
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,362
Can't you do all that in L.A.?

160
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,238
I want to do something
important.

161
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:30,325
I want to help people
and do good work

162
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:33,536
and sleep on the ground
and poop in a bucket.

163
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,914
Honey, nobody wants to
poop in a bucket.

164
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,875
Maybe I do. Maybe
I want to poop in a bucket.

165
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,419
If you want to poop in a
bucket, we can get you a bucket.

166
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,626
You don't have to go all the way
the chechnylavakia.

167
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:44,923
Am I saying that right?

168
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,800
It's not just
the pooping in a bucket.

169
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,887
I think it might be good for me
to get out of la.

170
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,637
For a little bit.

171
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,949
Sweetie, you know I support
you, whatever you want to do,

172
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,867
but you're not gonna find
what you're looking for

173
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,768
in these awful made-up places.

174
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:59,688
The universe
is a cruel, uncaring void.

175
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,107
The key to being happy
isn't a search for meaning.

176
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:05,318
It's to just keep yourself busy
with unimportant nonsense,

177
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,445
and eventually, you'll be dead.

178
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:11,116
Well, I guess
I can keep my options open.

179
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,282
Great.

180
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,163
Hey, can I ask you something?

181
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,917
Did Vincent seem extra weird
to you last night?

182
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,712
Well, he's still three kids
in a trench coat, so, no.

183
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,256
We're going through a rough
patch. It's hard, you know.

184
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,383
He's works a fulltime job
at the business factory,

185
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,884
so when he gets home,

186
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,095
he just wants to unwind
by watching r-rated movies.

187
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,502
Ahh, I thought I was ready
for a real adult relationship,

188
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:35,807
but...

189
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:38,435
Enough about me.
Bojack, you are on fire.

190
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,478
Oh, are we talking
about me again?

191
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,981
We have an offer on the table
for you to play the bad guy

192
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,441
in the new James Bond.

193
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,776
- Ehh.
- I agree. Total garbage.

194
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,487
But this, it's a new drama
from the Coen brothers.

195
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,032
A western about a one-horse town
and you're the horse.

196
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,534
Hello, Oscar. What do you think?

197
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,911
I think now's the time
to finally make "secretariat."

198
00:08:57,078 --> 00:09:00,415
Really? Now? Aren't you
a little, um, very too old?

199
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,601
You asked me what I wanted
to do. That's what I want.

200
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,836
That's all I've ever wanted,
and if I can't get it now,

201
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,172
then all of this
has been for nothing.

202
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:08,882
Oh, fish. Of course!

203
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,800
Why would you ever
make things easy for me

204
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,511
when instead you could make
things incredibly difficult?

205
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,638
Laura, clear out
the rest of my day.

206
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,515
I have to push a Boulder
up a hill,

207
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,809
and then have it roll over me
time and time again

208
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,811
with no regard
for my well-being.

209
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:22,978
Attagirl.

210
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:27,192
All right, Todd. Pb livin'
needs a new project.

211
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:30,570
Bi-monthly curated box of snacks
has been an enormous success,

212
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,947
but I got into this game
to make movies,

213
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,574
so let's make a movie.

214
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,409
Well, I got a stack
of great scripts here.

215
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,179
Any one of them
would make a wonderful movie.

216
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:39,662
Fantastic.

217
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:43,792
But I also have this other
non-movie-related idea.

218
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,293
Ooh, let's hear the other idea.

219
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,045
Okay. I was
heading down Wilshire,

220
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:50,173
and I saw this empty
store front, and I thought,

221
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,175
"you know what
this world needs?"

222
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:53,843
Edge of my seat over here.

223
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,555
A store where people can buy
Halloween stuff.

224
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,433
Halloween store.
Feel like that's been done.

225
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,352
Yeah, in October,

226
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,897
but how come your never see
a Halloween store in January?

227
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,191
- It's an untapped market.
- Yeah.

228
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,568
A Halloween store
that's open year round.

229
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,071
- No, no. Just January.
- Brilliant.

230
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:16,157
That's the kind of idea
that wins golden globes.

231
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,121
I actually think the time
is right for "secretariat,"

232
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,414
so what do you want to play,
like, secretariat's dad

233
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,167
or his grandfather, maybe like
an elderly witch doctor

234
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,169
who puts a curse on him
or something?

235
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,421
Lenny, look, I know
I'm a little long in the tooth,

236
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,215
but I think that you
more than anyone

237
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,592
would know
not to count out an old pro.

238
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,427
Don't play the ageism card
with me, kid.

239
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,914
I've laid farts that lasted
longer than your entire career.

240
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:42,100
But secretariat was dead at 27,
so who we kidding here?

241
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,147
Just set the project up
and give me an audition.

242
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:45,562
- That's all I ask.
- All right.

243
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,127
You got yourself
a "go" picture, kid.

244
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,065
And by you, I mean me.
And by "go" picture,

245
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,432
I mean I'll make some phone
calls and see what I can do.

246
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,654
And by kid,
I mean middle-aged adult.

247
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,778
Shh. No, no, no.
Put it here. Put it here.

248
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,994
- Okay, I'll do it.
- Ahem.

249
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:04,289
- Has this ever happened to you?
- Has what ever happened to me?

250
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:07,333
- Todd?
- Yes, Mr. Peanutbutter?

251
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,340
What's going on?
Why are you talking like that?

252
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,296
Todd, I just got
a phenomenal idea

253
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,006
for a Halloween costume.

254
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,276
Why don't you and I dash over
to the store right quick

255
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,510
and spend some hard-earned
American money?

256
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,471
Oh, but, Mr. Peanutbutter,
didn't you hear?

257
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,474
It's January, and
the Halloween store won't open

258
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,102
for another nine months.

259
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,563
But I want satisfaction now.

260
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,940
Has this ever happened to you?

261
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,984
Not to anyone ever at any time.

262
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:36,738
Ahem. We give you
Halloween in January,

263
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:39,866
a truly immersive
Halloween experience

264
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,993
for the rest of us.

265
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,704
Halloween in January?
Please elaborate.

266
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,956
Okay, but before I do,
tell the audience.

267
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,292
- Have we ever met before?
- Never.

268
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:53,046
Well, according to facts,
there's more suicides in January

269
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,632
- than any other month.
- I'm getting pretty close over here.

270
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:59,719
Also, there's less
Halloween stores. Coincidence?

271
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:03,348
Wow, I'm convinced.
This store could save lives.

272
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,225
Unbelievable.
When your powers combine...

273
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,811
You are somehow even more stupid
than the sum of your stupids.

274
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,605
- Thank you.
- Go on.

275
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:13,066
You stop encouraging him
and you stop encouraging him.

276
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,859
The two of you
are playing with fire.

277
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,153
A fire called
having a good idea.

278
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,906
Or maybe
a fire called friendship.

279
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,825
- Fires aren't called things.
- What about the Chicago fire?

280
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,202
Or fire island.

281
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:25,954
- Or Gabe.
- Who's Gabe?

282
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,914
Just a fire I met once.
Named him Gabe.

283
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,916
- He sounds delightful.
- He was. Good guy.

284
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,759
Business, business, business.
Is that all you ever think about?

285
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,052
I don't know.

286
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,054
What's under that coat, Vincent?

287
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,765
- You need to let me in.
- Not right now.

288
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,642
I have to call
the guy at the office

289
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,686
and take the car to the place.

290
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,479
It's always guys in places
with you.

291
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,731
You know, I thought
I wanted to date a real adult,

292
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,817
but I'm actually young at heart.

293
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,152
I need to feel the grass
between my toes.

294
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,697
I want to wear jeans.
I want to dance.

295
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,907
- That's baby stuff.
- No, Vincent.

296
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:05,618
There's more to being an adult
than just work and business

297
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,705
and the tall-person rides at
Disneyland. I want to have fun.

298
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,791
There has to be a difference
between monogamy and monotony.

299
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,210
What's mahumanunny?

300
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,212
Well, clearly we had
a different understanding

301
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,214
of what this was.

302
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:21,175
I'd like to be an adult about
this, but frankly, I'm hurt.

303
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,887
I think you should just go,
just git. Get out of my life.

304
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,556
Okay.

305
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,141
Okay.

306
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:31,269
Could I have another soda?

307
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:37,233
Bojack, you know
Kelsey jannings, our director.

308
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,485
I really appreciate you
giving me this opportunity.

309
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,029
Yeah.

310
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,781
Secretariat
was kind of my hero as a kid.

311
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,783
Yeah, he was
a lot of people's hero.

312
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,661
Well, you know, here was a guy
who had everything...

313
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,747
Yeah, I know the story.
I'm the director.

314
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,665
Kelsey, be nice.

315
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,852
She's just cranky because
she's already seen 30 people

316
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:57,545
read for this today,
and we are all so goddamn sick

317
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,756
of seeing auditions,
so whenever you're ready.

318
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,132
Justjump right in.

319
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:03,259
Great. Let's get to it.

320
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,553
Hey, ain't you that horse

321
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,222
- that won all them races?
- Not today, ma'am.

322
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:11,642
Today I'm just a customer
who wants a warm slice of pie.

323
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,478
Can I ask you a question?

324
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,480
When you're out there
on that there racetrack,

325
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,875
- what are you running from?
- You want to know the truth?

326
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,359
Nothing.

327
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,611
Everyone's running
from something, sugar.

328
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:25,698
No, I'm running from nothing.
I'm terrified of nothing.

329
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,784
People come up to me,
they want my autograph,

330
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,202
they want my picture.

331
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,996
They think they recognize
something in me,

332
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:35,083
and I want to be that person
they think I am, but I'm not.

333
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,668
They see a greatness in me, and
they mistake it for goodness,

334
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,713
but I... I know
there's nothing there.

335
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,843
As fast as I run,
I can't get way from that.

336
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,428
- Oh.
- Wow.

337
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,848
Bojack, I think I speak
for everyone when I say...

338
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:54,894
Oh, my god,
Andrew Garfield said yes.

339
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,730
- We have our secretariat.
- We got Andrew Garfield?

340
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,333
Oh, my god,
it's the best day of my life.

341
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:00,817
You don't say no to spider-man.

342
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,211
This movie is gonna be amazing.

343
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,277
Andrew...

344
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:06,406
Garfield!

345
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,367
Now, the pills
will give you nightmares...

346
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:10,660
I mean, just horrifying...

347
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,662
But the malaria
will give you death,

348
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,039
so you're going to want to
take the pills, Diane.

349
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,666
- Uh-huh.
- Hold on.

350
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:21,003
A mosquito got into my tent.
What do you want?

351
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,256
Hello?

352
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,591
Diane, it's Princess Carolyn,
bojack's agent.

353
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,218
Yeah, I know who you are.

354
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,345
I'm the pink cat, the one
who used to date bojack.

355
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,098
We've met a lot of times.
You came to my wedding.

356
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,599
Listen, the turteltaub company

357
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,601
is making a movie
about secretariat.

358
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,478
And since you're such an expert,

359
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,648
they want to bring you on board
as a character consultant.

360
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,400
What does that mean?

361
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,087
Oh, it's the cushiest job
in the world.

362
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,088
You sit in a fancy chair
and eat pastries all day.

363
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,906
And then once a week, you say,
"secretariat wouldn't do that."

364
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,176
I don't know. I've already
been offered this other thing.

365
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,286
And did you know
there are orphans in Sudan...

366
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,431
Honey, you take this job, you can buy
all the orphans you want.

367
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,123
No, I don't want to buy them.

368
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,125
Look, if you really
want to help people,

369
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,395
it doesn't hurt to have
a little money in your pocket.

370
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,463
Take the job now,
help the orphans later.

371
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,798
- There's always later.
- Hmm.

372
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,317
Okay, talk it over
with your husband.

373
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,968
I got to go
get my whiskers trimmed.

374
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:12,263
I run into walls for days,
but I look hot.

375
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,225
- How's the pie here?
- Not good.

376
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,852
Well, I'll take all you got.

377
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,746
Screw it. Throw it in a bowl
with some bourbon

378
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,898
- and bring me a ladle.
- Mm-hmm.

379
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:25,735
Bojack, we notice you've been
pretty down in the dumps lately,

380
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:29,614
but we have something that we
think is going to cheer you up.

381
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,657
It's an exciting
new business venture

382
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,035
that's equal parts
new and exciting.

383
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:36,746
Another one? What happened
to your Halloween store?

384
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,247
- What now?
- Oh, right.

385
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,124
The Halloween store.

386
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,043
We took the floor out

387
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,670
because Mr. Peanutbutter
kept scratching up the hardwood,

388
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,548
and then... did we ever get
the new floor installed?

389
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,718
Halloween? In January?

390
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:53,304
What a great ide... aah!

391
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,391
Anyway, now we're
all about smoodies.

392
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,560
- What?
- Smoodies.

393
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,367
You're saying smoothies,
right? Smoothies.

394
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,855
No. Smoodies.

395
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,608
It's a mood that you drink
like a smoothie.

396
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:08,444
I don't understand it.
How do you drink a mood?

397
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,738
- Like a smoothie.
- So it is a smoothie.

398
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:14,575
No, it's a smoodie...
A mood that you drink.

399
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:18,287
- How do you drink a mood?
- Like a smoothie.

400
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,541
But do you buy it in a store?
What're the physical attributes?

401
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,543
We haven't worked out
all the kinks yet,

402
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,545
but the important thing is
we've gone public,

403
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,713
and we want you to get in on
the ground floor.

404
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,680
See, that's the problem
with all your ideas...

405
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,717
They don't have ground floors.

406
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,888
Finally, a Halloween store
for the rest of... aah!

407
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,350
Hello.

408
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,936
Anyway,
our launch party's tonight,

409
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,647
- and we'd love it if you came.
- We spared no expense...

410
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,899
That's how confident we are
in our product.

411
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,484
- Your product... smoodies.
- Yes.

412
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:51,279
Wait, did you say smoodies
or smoothies?

413
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,406
Because we only make...
Which one do we make?

414
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,866
I'd like to think
the smoodies make us.

415
00:17:56,033 --> 00:18:00,079
Ahh, I can tell by your tone
that that was something smart.

416
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,710
- Smoodie keychain?
- Smoodie cozy?

417
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,128
-Smoodie bottle opener?

418
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:09,380
It's a mood that you drink
like a smoothie.

419
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,382
Todd, it is all happening.

420
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:14,927
Hooray. And you know I don't
throw that word around lightly.

421
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,388
All right. Now we just got to
make sure we focus

422
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,348
and actually follow through
on this.

423
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,976
I'd feel awful
if this great idea fell apart

424
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,270
because we got distracted
by something else,

425
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,813
as we are often won't to do.

426
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,650
Wait, did you say
you feel awful or falafel?

427
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,402
I said, "feel awful,"

428
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:34,572
but tell me more
about this falafel idea.

429
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:37,700
Falafel or fawaffle?

430
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,076
What?

431
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:49,253
Bojack, isn't this exciting?
Smoodies, right?

432
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,797
Do you even know
what a smoodie is?

433
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,799
I think it's some kind of
an adult onesie.

434
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,926
Whatever it is,
I'm trying new things.

435
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,554
I'm single again,
and I'm loving it.

436
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:01,557
- Let me repeat...
- Princess Carolyn.

437
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:04,769
Vincent. Well, you've got
some nerve showing your face.

438
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:08,147
- I've got half a mind to...
- No, let me talk.

439
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:11,108
I had a attitude problem,

440
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,277
but then I took a time-out,

441
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:15,196
and I thought about what I did.

442
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:17,323
I wanted to be a big man.

443
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:22,662
But sometimes the biggest thing
a man can do is tell the truth.

444
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:26,082
And the truth about me is,
I... I...

445
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,792
- Okay, here we go.
- I love you.

446
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,919
- What?
- Oh, Vincent.

447
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:33,047
Let's go feel grass
between our toes.

448
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:35,007
- Let's!
- All right.

449
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,176
You're a better man
than I could ever be.

450
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,969
I wish my boyfriend
was that mature.

451
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:43,099
- Hello?
- Bojack, it's Kelsey jannings.

452
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,850
I got some news
about "secretariat."

453
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,228
- What's up?
- Garfield's out.

454
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,021
He got into
some sort of accident.

455
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,232
An all hallows' Eve store
in January?

456
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:54,527
How fiendishly droll. Aah!

457
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,613
Oh, bother.

458
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,740
The clumsy bastard
broke every bone in his body,

459
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,617
and now we got to find
a new lead.

460
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,864
Studio wants to go young,
but I was thinking we'd get

461
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,747
someone a little more
bojack horseman.

462
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,666
What? Are you serious?

463
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,852
You're the only one with
enough grit to play the part,

464
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,313
and we can age you down in post,
but I'm gonna tell you right now,

465
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,464
not gonna put up with
any woe-is-me bullshit

466
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,091
or diva histrionics.

467
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:18,759
I get enough of that
from my ex-wife

468
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,137
along with newspaper clippings
about gluten.

469
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,556
God, we get it, Marla. Gluten.

470
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,083
But if you want to make a movie,
and you're ready to work...

471
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,352
I am. I will. I can. I do.

472
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,080
Great. You got one month
to get in shape.

473
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:32,231
You need to lose 50 pounds
and then gain back 20.

474
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:33,858
- And, bojack...
- Yeah?

475
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,693
Don't ever call this number.

476
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,319
If I want to talk,
I'll call you.

477
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,868
- Hey.
- Hey.

478
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,536
Not big on parties, huh?

479
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,788
Nah. I never know what to do
with my hands.

480
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,291
I think I just got cast
in "secretariat."

481
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,419
- That's amazing.
- It's everything I ever wanted.

482
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:56,714
- Yeah, you seem super-jazzed.
- What do I do now?

483
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:59,300
Well, that's the problem
with life, right?

484
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,945
Either you know what you want,
and you don't get what you want,

485
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,388
or get what you want, and then
you don't know what you want.

486
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:07,141
- Well, that's stupid.
- Yeah.

487
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:09,327
I don't know if this makes you
more or less excited,

488
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,896
but I actually decided to take
a job on the secretariat movie

489
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,939
as a character consultant.

490
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,859
Wow, so we're gonna be
working together again.

491
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,861
Yeah. I hope
you don't get sick of me.

492
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:20,654
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

493
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,324
- Is it weird I took this job?
- Why would it be weird?

494
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:25,785
You literally wrote the book
on secretariat.

495
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:29,497
Yeah, I know. I just...
When I first moved to la...

496
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,458
I thought I was gonna be doing
really important work.

497
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,794
You know, writing stuff
that makes a difference.

498
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,005
But then you kind of fall into
one thing and then another...

499
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:40,257
Well, you've got time.
There's always later, right?

500
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,218
Yeah, I guess
there's always later.

501
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,345
Do you remember
the last time I saw you?

502
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:47,139
You asked me if I thought you
were a good person deep down.

503
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,017
Do I remember that?
Yeah, vaguely.

504
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:52,561
You caught me off guard.
I didn't know what to say.

505
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:56,565
Well, do you think
I'm a good person... deep down?

506
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,193
That's the thing. I don't
think I believe in deep down.

507
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,696
I kind of think all you are
is just the things that you do.

508
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,825
Well, that's depressing.

509
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,660
For what it's worth,

510
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,578
I think your writing
does make a difference.

511
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,121
Thanks.

512
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,541
I really wanted you
to like me, Diane.

513
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,417
I know.

514
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:32,560
J“ I know I've dreamed you I

515
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:36,939
j'a sin and a lie I

516
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,946
j“ I have my freedom I

517
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:50,578
j“ but I don't have much time j“

518
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:57,668
j“ let's do some living j“

519
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:04,383
j“ after we die j“

520
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:09,972
j“ wild horses j“

521
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:15,269
j“ we'll ride them someday j”

522
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:19,106
sorry we didn't get you
a birthday present.

523
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:21,191
I got so distracted
by trying to get tickets

524
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,235
to the new kids on the block
concert,

525
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,946
I completely lost sight
of what's important.

526
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,949
And I got so swept up in
my campaign for class president,

527
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,869
I forgot why I was running
in the first place.

528
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:33,871
And I was boy crazy.

529
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:35,998
Kids, kids,
I don't need a present.

530
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,208
I got everything I need
right here.

531
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:42,421
- Macaroni.
- Sabrina.

532
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,632
Come here, you goofball.

533
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:00,814
- Aha.
- Whoa.

534
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,581
- Can you make it out to Blake?
- Uh-huh.

535
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:05,069
Thanks, man.
You're, like, my hero.

536
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,363
Really?

537
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:08,529
Huh.

538
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:25,673
J“ all I want to know is j”

539
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,051
j“ can you come
a little closer j“

540
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,473
j“ the doors are open
the wind is really blowing j“

541
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,268
j“ the night sky
is changing overhead j“

542
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:41,313
j“ it's not just all physical j“

543
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,192
j“ I'm the type who won't get
oh so critical j“

544
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:48,654
j“ so let's
make things physical j“

545
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:52,449
j“ I won't treat you like
you're oh so typical j“

546
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,867
j“ oh-oh-oh j“

547
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,703
j“ oh-oh-oh j“

548
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:59,289
j“ I won't treat you like
you're typical j“

549
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:02,793
j“ I want you close I want you I

550
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,713
j“ I won't treat you like
you're typical j“

551
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:09,174
j“ all I wanna get is j“

552
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:12,970
j“ a little bit closer j“

553
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:16,056
j“ all I wanna know is j“

554
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:19,184
j“ can you come a little closer j“

555
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,316
boxer versus raptor.
Na na na na na.
