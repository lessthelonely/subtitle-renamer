00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:12,012
<i>-Sir, please get back into your car.</i>
<i>-Here's how it's gonna go down.</i>

00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:13,180
<i>You're gonna let me go.</i>

5
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:16,600
<i>If you're lucky,</i>
<i>I might even honk your... boobies!</i>

6
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,018
<i>Whoa! Hey! Hey!</i>

7
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,354
<i>-for assaulting a police officer.</i>
<i>-You're arresting me?</i>

8
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,397
<i>You must be new here,</i>
<i>on the rag, or both.</i>

00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:25,692
<i>I'm movie star Vance Waggoner,</i>
<i>and I hate Jews!</i>

00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,070
[drums] This is the<i> Deep Dive!</i>

11
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:32,199
My guest today recently said some things,
or did some things?

12
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,785
I only read the headline.
Vance, what happened?

13
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:35,827
[sighs]

14
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:37,829
First of all, I don't hate Jews.

15
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:39,915
If I did, would I be able to sit
in the same room

16
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:42,376
as my good friend Mark Feuerstein, a Jew?

17
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,170
You know, when I first heard
Vance's comments, they stung,

18
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,299
but when he called to offer his apology
and a supporting role in his next movie,

19
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:52,094
I thought, "Does not the Torah
teach us to forgive?"

20
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,930
As it is written, "schmear, don't smear."

21
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:59,017
[drums] Hey! Good to see you.
Thanks for coming, everyone!

22
00:00:59,101 --> 00:00:59,935
[camera clicking]

23
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:02,688
Hey! Hey, Vance, did you get practice
swinging that baseball bat

24
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:05,566
from the time you hit that prostitute,
with a baseball bat?

25
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,317
What? Who told you that?

26
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,072
I'm Tom Jumbo-Grumbo,
and this is<i> Gotcha!</i>

27
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,741
Vance Waggoner,
you hit a woman with a baseball bat.

28
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,159
What's your side of the story?

29
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,869
Okay, look,
when that altercation occurred,

30
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:22,082
I was an immature child... of 38.
I'm not that guy anymore.

31
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,834
Vance Waggoner respects women.

32
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:27,629
We have a tape of a voicemail you left
for your 14-year-old daughter.

33
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:30,340
-Oh, God.
-Let's give it a listen, shall we?

34
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:31,717
-[tone beeps]
<i>-I'll murder you.</i>

35
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,178
<i>I'm going to murder my daughter.</i>
<i>I don't respect women.</i>

36
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:39,349
<i>You're out there, hanging out</i>
<i>with your dirty Swedish friends.</i>

37
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,184
<i>That's right, I hate Swedes now.</i>

38
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,644
<i>I bet you didn't see </i>that <i>coming,</i>

39
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:45,689
<i>-you disgusting slut, who is my </i>daughter!
-[tone beeps]

40
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:49,276
As we say here on<i> Gotcha,</i>
that's<i> a gotcha.</i>

41
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,570
Why did I go on a show called<i> Gotcha?</i>

42
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,113
[camera shutters clicking]

43
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:56,742
I stand here with my wife beside me,
and my daughter,

44
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,827
and my good friend Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd.

45
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,954
-I am retiring from public life.
-[press corps gasps]

46
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:03,540
This is the last you'll see
of Vance Waggoner.

47
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:09,796
Who are we gonna get
to play Philbert's partner?

48
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,758
We need a bad boy.
Someone dangerous,

49
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:17,095
someone you see coming
and think, "This guy is trouble."

50
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,390
You know who would be perfect?

51
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,685
[theme music playing]

52
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,698
[growls, grunts]

53
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,787
-Thank you so much for meeting me.
-Of course.

54
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,247
I know how busy you are.

55
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,459
The Apology Tour can be a hassle,
but you've been handling it perfectly.

56
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,877
What do you have lined up next?

57
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:34,131
Well, I'm getting the lifetime achievement
at the We Forgive You Awards.

58
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:38,009
You're getting a Forgivie?
Damn, your publicist <i>is </i>good.

59
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,262
I don't care about awards.
I just want to work, damn it.

60
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,180
You just have to remind them
how good you are.

61
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:46,226
Maybe by taking a meaty role on my gritty,
prestige television show<i> Philbert.</i>

62
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,979
Once word gets out
that it's okay to hire you again,

63
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,607
all the other offers will come rolling in.
Producers are like lemmings.

64
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,151
-Hey, I resent that!
-Me, too!

65
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,320
-I also resent that. To the cliff!
-Yeah, let's go.

66
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:00,031
I have a great deal of love and respect
for the lemming community!

67
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,908
Okay, I'm in.

68
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,997
Diane, can you believe this?

69
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,500
Vance Waggoner is getting
a We Forgive You Award!

70
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,836
Ugh! This town is full of hypocrites.

71
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,339
They act all shocked when one of their
favorite stars turns out to be a dirtbag,

72
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,634
but they can't wait to give a comeback
to all the dirtbags we already know about.

73
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:23,054
Now, that is the kind of story
I would share without reading,

74
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,849
which, for our purposes,
is even better than people reading.

75
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,184
Go to the awards show,

76
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,853
take down that skeevy so-and-so,

77
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:33,023
and then during commercial breaks,
get in some Hollywoo hobnobbing.

78
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,443
-Oh, I'd rather not.
-Diane, you have to hobnob.

79
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,820
Have you not been hobnobbing?
Hob that nob, girl!

80
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:41,740
We know how this ends.
Our core readership eats it up,

81
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,075
a bunch of dude-bros
call me a "dumb slunt,"

82
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,952
and Vance's career chugs, right along.

83
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:49,247
So, stellar! And while you're there,
you can ask your friend BoJack,

84
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,625
why Vance is gonna co-star
on his new TV show.

85
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,251
He's what? Oop! Aaaah!

86
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,670
[explosive music]

87
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,089
Greetings, from the red carpet!

88
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:02,093
Filling in for a Mario Lopez-type,
'tis I, Mr. Peanutbutter!

89
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:03,261
-And lookie here!
-[yelps]

90
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:07,432
Super-producer and also my manager,
Princess Carolyn!

91
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:08,725
Who are you wearing

92
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,478
and why haven't you called,
about the<i> Dog Day Afternoon</i> reboot?

93
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,813
-Uh...
-It's cool. We can talk.

94
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,440
-They cut around stuff they don't need.
-Oh, okay.

95
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,903
No one understands how to make a woman
feel beautiful like Louis Kitton.

96
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,615
Listen, kid.<i> Dog Day Afternoon</i>
isn't gonna happen for you.

97
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,243
-People don't see you as the tough guy.
-That's not fair.

98
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,119
Who are you excited to see tonight?

99
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:31,081
So many amazing stars
are being forgiven tonight.

100
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,375
Megyn Kelly, Mark Wahlberg...
[laughs]

101
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,252
Look, every actor has a range,

102
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,587
and maybe a gritty drama
about a tough-guy bank robber

103
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,130
is too much of a stretch for you.

104
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,591
So, I'm not tough enough, huh?

105
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,594
I'll show them how tough I can be.

106
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:50,350
We'll be back with more of the Red Carpet
Pre-Show Fashion-Stravaganza,

107
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,895
so don't touch that remote...
[growls] or else.

108
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,146
[choral music playing]

109
00:05:56,022 --> 00:06:00,443
There is no one this town loves
forgiving more than Vance Waggoner.

110
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:01,361
[applause]

111
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,280
I just don't get why you're doing this.

112
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,615
-We need a big star, Diane.
-No, Diane's right.

113
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,367
-I'm the big star.
-That's not my point.

114
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,077
You can't have two stars.

115
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,163
All the greatest detective shows
are focused around a central,

116
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:13,957
usually titular character.

117
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,167
Kojak, Monk, Nickis.

118
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,961
-Who's Nickis?
-You know, Nickis.

119
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,755
Sometimes, he goes to Los Angeles,
to New Orleans...

120
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:24,676
Are you...? Do you mean<i> NCIS?</i>

121
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,052
No.

122
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:29,639
Princess Carolyn, if you hire this guy,
what kind of message does that send?

123
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,808
Diane, we both know
the industry is screwed up.

124
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,185
I'm not talking to the industry.
I'm talking to you.

125
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,896
-Take some responsibility.
-Excuse me?

126
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:36,813
Hey! Cheese plate!

127
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,648
...Vance Waggoner!

128
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,317
[cheering, applause]

129
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,069
-Ugh!
-[camera clicks]

130
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:47,282
Horseman forcefully forgoes applause
for Vance at Forgivies!

131
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,492
Is a feud forming on the<i> Philbert</i> front?

132
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:53,079
That's the buzz around town,
and the question on everybody's mind is,

133
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,664
"Why the strong face?"

134
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:59,127
He made the face in protest because
of what Vance said about native Alaskans.

135
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,088
BoJack's clearly upset
about the time Vance Waggoner

136
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:07,302
said the Madrid train bombings
were "a real mixed bag."

137
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,347
Remember when Vance locked
that shopgirl in a hotel room

138
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,809
and said, "I've got pizzazz"
while masturbating into a champagne flute?

139
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:17,062
Because BoJack remembers.
[slurps]

140
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:21,524
God damn it! The whole point of the award
was to put the past behind me.

141
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,069
But now,
because of this idiot's dumb face,

142
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,529
my past is all anyone's talking about!

143
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,823
Everyone else was clapping.
Why couldn't you clap?

144
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,326
Hey, man, awards show
should've had better cheese.

145
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:34,829
-My publicist is furious, by the way.
-Ooh, spooky publicist!

146
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:37,499
Hope she doesn't papercut me
with her mad press release.

147
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:38,667
We're gonna handle this.

148
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:43,088
BoJack will go on TV and explain
this unfortunate<i> faux pas du fromage.</i>

149
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,465
-Won't you, BoJack?
-Ugh. Fine.

150
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:49,636
Once again, hero BoJack will clean up
everyone else's mess.

151
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,558
-Hello, Todd.
-Ooh!

152
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:59,604
Did you notice how I just walked in
without knocking? Pretty tough, huh?

153
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:00,522
Not at all!

154
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,774
To me, it read as amiable and familiar,

155
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,902
like our friendship has an assumed
"open door" policy.

156
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,154
God damn it! [thumps] Owie!

157
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,824
Apparently, Hollywoo producers
don't think I'm tough enough

158
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,492
to play the bad boy parts.

159
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,995
-Oh, no!
-Todd, you're the toughest guy I know.

160
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,204
[giggles]

161
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:20,500
-Will you teach me how to be tough?
-I thought you'd never ask.

162
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,795
Because I had no idea
this was happening to you.

163
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,214
-[audience applauding]
-[music playing]

164
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:31,261
BoJack, clear the air.
Why'd you give Vance the face?

165
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,721
Well, there was this cheese--

166
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,305
And you're lactose intolerant,

167
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,558
which reminded you
that Vance lacks tolerance?

168
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,559
No, it--

169
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:38,935
The cheese stands alone,

170
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,938
but no woman should stand alone,
when standing up to sexual harassment?

171
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,773
-Squawk!
-No, it wasn't any of those things!

172
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:47,193
So, you're saying it wasn't any<i> one </i>thing,
more of an accumulation?

173
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,320
-It--
-BoJack, it is really incredible,

174
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,072
your taking a stand against your co-star.

175
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:54,784
-No, I'm not taking any stand--
-I mean, the guy choked his wife,

176
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,787
and most of Hollywoo is, like,
"No biggie. Good for him!"

177
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,915
-Squawk!
-Okay, well, obviously it's not good

178
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,000
he choked his wife.

179
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,501
-Wow!
-[cheering, applause]

180
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:06,588
No, no, no! I wasn't trying to make
some bold statement or anything.

181
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,923
It's just that...
choking your wife is bad.

182
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,592
[cheering and applauding]

183
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,343
Really?

184
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:14,512
Okay.

185
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:19,517
Can I just tell you how amazing it is
to hear a <i>man </i>say that?

186
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:22,228
Well, Paloma,
someone needed to take a stand.

187
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,730
[cheering and applauding]

188
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:27,525
Call me crazy. I mean,
this is just old BoJack talking,

189
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:30,904
-but how about we don't choke <i>any </i>women?
-[cheering]

190
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:34,866
So true, right? Don't choke women!

191
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,077
[all chanting] Don't choke women!

192
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,286
BoJack is right.

193
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,455
Hollywoo shouldn't legitimize abusers,

194
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,083
by allowing them to star
in movies and TV shows,

195
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,627
that play off their problematic personas!

196
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,962
[audience] Hollywoo
shouldn't legitimize abusers

197
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,673
by allowing them to star
in movies and TV shows

198
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,635
that play off
their problematic personas!

199
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,845
-All right!
-Squawk!

200
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,722
And speaking
of battering women,

201
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:01,643
right after the break, we'll show you
how to make the perfect blueberry pancake.

202
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:05,605
-With proud feminist, BoJack Horseman.
-Stick around!

203
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,649
And don't choke women! [chuckles]

204
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,484
[signal buzzes]

205
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,446
How is it you consistently do the opposite
of the thing I need you to do?

206
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,948
I don't know, Princess Carolyn.

207
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,908
Is it possible, this whole time,

208
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,869
I've been an amazing feminist hero,
and nobody knew it?

209
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,538
-BoJack!
-Feels pretty right.

210
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,499
Yeah, I'm a male feminist.
You're welcome, society.

211
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,251
-I gotta call Vance.
-Okay.

212
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,837
I'm just gonna stay here, being woke.

213
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,965
Vance! Listen,
BoJack's been very dehydrated.

214
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:36,052
No, no, no. You can't use the old
"dehydration made him stupid" trick on me.

215
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,222
Okay?
I'm Mr. Dehydration-Made-Me-Stupid.

216
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,683
BoJack really wants to work with you.
He just got caught up--

217
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,309
Doesn't matter.
I'm not doing the show.

218
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,352
<i>-What?</i>
-You were right.

219
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,687
All it took was one offer.

220
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,940
Once word got out I was doing<i> Philbert,</i>
all the other offers started pouring in.

221
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,275
You signed a contract!

222
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,945
Oh, please. I sexted a 12-year-old
and still got a Humanitas Prize.

223
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,781
You think I can't get out of a contract,
with a time website?

224
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,826
By the way, still very sorry
about sexting that 12-year-old.

225
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,369
[groans] Oh-hh!

226
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,414
Hey, Princess Carolyn,
you ever notice how, as a woman,

227
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,292
you only make ten cents
for every dollar your clients make?

228
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:11,421
-Really makes you think, huh?
-BoJack, I was wrong, you were right.

229
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,673
Let's take that asshole down.

230
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,593
So, <i>now, </i>you wanna take him down

231
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,553
Now, that he's not doing
your TV show, anymore?

232
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,762
Diane, don't be cynical.

233
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,723
-<i>I'm </i>cynical?
-What do you want me to say?

234
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,392
I got blinded by my desire
to see myself succeed,

235
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,395
which, since I'm a woman,
is actually very feminist.

236
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,522
But now that Vance can't help me succeed,

237
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:34,027
I realize the more feminist thing to do
is to make sure <i>he</i> doesn't succeed either.

238
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:37,447
-<i>I'm </i>cynical?
-I'm offering an olive branch, here.

239
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,617
Look, this town loves assholes like Vance.
There's nothing we can do.

240
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,286
This town is as wishy-washy
as a virgin on prom night.

241
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:47,540
All they need to listen to women
is the right voice-- a <i>man's </i>voice.

242
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,334
[BoJack] Oh!

243
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:52,212
-Is that why I'm here?
-Yep. I brought you two together

244
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:55,632
because between your feminist brain
and your stupid manly face,

245
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,092
you can actually say things
that people will listen to.

246
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,345
That's a good point.
People do listen to me all the time.

247
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:04,224
One time I tweeted "RIP David Bowie,"
and now everyone still thinks he's dead.

248
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,768
-David Bowie <i>is </i>dead.
-Wait, for real? Oh, man.

249
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:11,564
So, through BoJack, I can say
whatever I want, to a huge audience,

250
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:15,860
without being called "shrill,"
or "naggy," or "classic Diane."

251
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,820
Yeah. Everyone loves a male feminist.

252
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,281
It turns out, the problem
with feminism, all along,

253
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,033
is it just wasn't men doing it.

254
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,451
We're much less shrill.

255
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,287
Yeah, this is truly a great day
for women everywhere.

256
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,539
[rock music playing]

257
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,293
Okay, how do I make people think
I'm a tough bad boy,

258
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,754
who doesn't give a care
about society's precious rules?

259
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,632
Every time Vance Waggoner
breaks the rules,

260
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,968
-it gets caught on camera.
-That's it!

261
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,720
We just need some video evidence
of me being tough!

262
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,222
Here, record this.

263
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:45,473
Ooooh!

00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:35,023
-Okay, just...
-[marker squeaking]

282
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:39,110
[sighs] Okay, so, pop culture
inherently normalizes things,

283
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,987
and that power works both ways.

284
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,613
<i>It can normalize things for good,</i>

285
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:45,908
<i>like how dancing Ellen makes</i>
<i>middle America less afraid of gay people.</i>

286
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,910
<i>But it can also normalize things</i>
<i>for bad,</i>

287
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:51,831
<i>like what Jack Bauer did for torture,</i>
<i>or what Jimmy Fallon did for lip-syncing.</i>

288
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:55,376
So, when we give a platform
to known abusers like Vance Waggoner,

289
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,628
that's an example of...?

290
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,758
Normalizing things for...?

291
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,220
-Good or bad?
-I'm sorry.

292
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:08,556
I know you're trying really hard
not to be boring,

293
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,725
and it's kind of not boring,

294
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,478
but it still mostly feels
like I'm being lectured at.

295
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,687
-Okay, well--
-Hold on.

296
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,982
Let me imagine that I'm saying it.
You know what, that's a little better.

297
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,193
Well, the bar for men is depressingly low.

298
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:24,197
Just sprinkle in a few words like
"intersectionality" or "micro-aggressions"

299
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,783
and<i> Vice News </i>will name you
Feminist of the Year.

300
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,993
Oh, should I wear a T-shirt
that says "Feminism is Bae"?

301
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,495
Girls love shit like that, right?

302
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,663
[sighs] Sounds great, BoJack.

303
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,085
[door closes]

304
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:41,381
-Hello, Diane.
-[yelps] How did you get in my car?

305
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:44,300
-You left it unlocked.
-It's a Prius. It locks automatically.

306
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,386
Priuses<i> unlock</i> automatically.

307
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,596
You still need to lock it
when you get out.

308
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,015
-Really?
-I know you and your little Scooby gang

309
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:54,852
are plotting something against my client,
and I want you to stop.

310
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:58,481
Ugh! Of course that dirtbag
would hire Ana Spanakopita.

311
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:02,360
Vance has a troubled past.
All he's asking for is a fresh start.

312
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:06,155
-No. Why does he get that over and over?
-He's reformed.

313
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,615
What else would you have him do?

314
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,743
Let's say, you can make him do
anything you want to make things right.

315
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:14,622
What would you make
Vance Waggoner do, now?

316
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,126
Nothing.
I don't think he can make things right.

317
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,545
Well, then, what do you hope
to accomplish, here?

318
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,796
Can't you just admit to me,

319
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,674
just between the two of us,
that this sucks?

320
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:28,302
You can say it's your job, that you
believe in "forgiveness," whatever,

321
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:30,430
but don't you at least a little bit think

322
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,348
that when we let guys
like Vance off the hook...

323
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,809
-Diane.
-...when you, as a woman,

324
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,019
give awful men
the cover of your friendship,

325
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,105
when you work for them.
First of all,

326
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,150
they're not gonna get better.
Second of all, you are then complicit...

327
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:46,195
no, you're culpable
for the terrible things they do.

328
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,488
Are you done?

329
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:52,285
Just, woman to woman,
can't you admit this is screwed up?

330
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,455
You've given me a lot to think about.

331
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,293
-[walking away]
-[remote chirps, lock clicks]

332
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,961
Oh...!

333
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,798
So, in conclusion,
is Smurfette a feminist icon?

334
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,718
I think the better question is,
why does she have to be?,

335
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:12,054
We've gotten a little off track, here.
We were talking about Vance Waggoner.

336
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:12,972
Oh, yeah!

337
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,100
We actually have a tape of a press
conference Vance gave, earlier today.

338
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:17,518
-What?
-And he mentioned you in it.

339
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,353
Oh, no, is this a<i> Gotcha?</i>
Am I the gotcha?

340
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:20,771
Let's see what he had to say.

341
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:23,441
I have an important announcement.

342
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,068
-I... am a feminist, too.
-[applause]

343
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:31,657
That's why I had to walk away
from BoJack Horseman's new show<i> Philbert.</i>

344
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:34,619
Okay, I read the scripts they sent me,
and I was outraged.

345
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:38,748
Gratuitous sexual violence.
Protracted, lascivious nude scenes.

346
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:42,001
Maybe BoJack Horseman thinks
that's all in good fun,

347
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,294
but I know it's toxic.

348
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,838
And if I took part in it,
I would be complicit--

349
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,841
no, culpable for that toxicity.

350
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:51,260
BoJack, what do you say to those charges?

351
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,428
Um...

352
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,222
The future is female?

353
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:58,893
[chuckles]

354
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,938
Pretty cool, huh?

355
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:06,025
-Uh, are you sure about this outfit?
-All the toughest guys wear leather.

356
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:09,820
Biker gangs, motorcycle cops,
non-heteronormative dominatrices.

357
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:14,367
Well, this is the sleaziest,
most dangerous dive bar in Hollywoo.

358
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:19,622
It's where all the bad boys party.
Charlie Sheen, Chris Brown, Subway Jared.

359
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:23,834
Great. I'll waltz right in, fight
a few bouncers, throw a drink in a face,

360
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:27,588
and get this menacing mug
on the cover of a few tabloids.

361
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,341
-Hey.
-[Peanutbutter] Hey! Bird brains!

362
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:33,302
Why don't you snap
some pics of me being mean?

363
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:37,181
Get the word out
that I'm a real tough SOAB!

364
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:39,725
-You? Tough? Yeah, right!
-Hah!

365
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:45,022
I've seen tougher guys at the fancy-boy
bubble bath parties I sometimes attend.

366
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,400
-What?
-Sorry, I can't invite ya.

367
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,277
Fancy boys only.

368
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,196
-Well, you two have a pleasant afternoon.
-No, Mr. Peanutbutter.

369
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,658
-Show 'em your tough stuff!
-Oh, yeah!

370
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,034
[growls]

371
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,620
-[barks]
-[birds yelp]

372
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,205
Oh, my God, are you guys okay?

373
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,749
-Did you hear that?
-No.

374
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,918
Exactly. No more clicking.

375
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:10,089
You fixed my TMJ, which means
no more wearing a night guard to bed.

376
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:14,051
Wow, I already feel like a more confident
and assertive lover.

377
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:15,595
Thanks, Mr. Peanutbutter.

378
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:20,641
I'm gonna go home
and make love to my <i>wiiiiiiiiiiiiife!</i>

379
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:21,559
Uh...

380
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:24,770
My crossed eye. It-- it's fixed!

381
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:27,440
My depth perception
is so much better now.

382
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,400
I'm gonna go watch a Wes Anderson movie

383
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,945
and see if I can perceive
any depth in <i>iiiiiiiiiiit!</i>

384
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,365
And stay out!

385
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,244
Whoa.

386
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:44,081
-So... did Philbert kill his wife?
-Well, Sassy thinks so.

387
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:46,125
That's why she's pretending
to be his new partner,

388
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,418
to get closer to the truth.

389
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,545
Meanwhile, his old partner Fritz
is back in the mix,

390
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,422
but he might be dead
and just a projection

391
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,175
-of Philbert's lingering guilt.
-Ooooh!

392
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:57,011
-That's very unclear.
-Yeah, the whole thing's nonsense,

393
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,389
but, more importantly,
how do we prove it's not sexist?

394
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:01,849
-It is sexist.
-No, of course.

395
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:05,102
But right now, I have to do an interview
where I explain that it's not,

396
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:07,271
because otherwise,
I'll look like a hypocrite,

397
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,690
which would be really bad
for women everywhere.

398
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,318
So, in order to save feminism,

399
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,320
you need to give me
some smart-sounding reasons

400
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:17,198
why Philbert
isn't what it so obviously is,

401
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,326
so that I can continue to be a hero
and role model.

402
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,536
Everything Vance said
about these scripts is true.

403
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:26,165
It's posing as a deconstruction
of the edifice of toxic masculinity...

404
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,917
Uh-huh. Toxic masculinity, yeah. Right.

405
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,171
But it's just using that, as an excuse
to relish in its own excesses.

406
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:35,299
And the most depressing thing...
is that ten times more people

407
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:38,135
are gonna watch this show
than read anything I've ever written.

408
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,429
I feel you're not really getting
into the spirit here.

409
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,349
We can still take down Vance
and topple the patriarchy.

410
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,227
Come on, we're doing feminism,
it's supposed to be fun!

411
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,603
This isn't fun for me!

412
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:51,357
Being a woman is not a hobby
or a pet interest of mine.

413
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,694
You get to drop in, and play Joss Whedon,
and everybody cheers.

414
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:57,655
But when you move on
to your next thing, I'm still here.

415
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,032
Okay, yeah, I totally get that.
But in the meantime,

416
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:02,076
I just need to know what to say
about this show.

417
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,328
Say whatever you want.
I have a listicle to write.

418
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:06,831
So, unless you can give me
"five times Rihanna gave us life,"

419
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,374
this conversation is over.

420
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:14,505
BoJack Horseman
is our<i> Deep Dive</i> guest, today.

421
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:18,050
So, what's going on?
Something about your show being sexist?

422
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:21,345
My producer printed out an article
for me, but I did not read it.

423
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:23,723
Look, obviously,
when you take plot points out of context,

424
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:24,890
they can seem unsavory.

425
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:30,146
But they're all part of a larger attempt
to deconstruct... toxic... masculinity.

426
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,148
Ooh! Sounds glamorous!

427
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,358
No, we're not glamorizing it,
that's the thing.

428
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:37,778
You're not supposed to like John Philbert
or agree with the things he does.

429
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:40,197
It's a TV show.
It doesn't glamorize anything.

430
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:43,284
But... maybe it normalizes it.

431
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,035
I gotta go.

432
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:51,167
Okay. We still have 48 minutes,
so, I guess <i>I </i>should just talk?

433
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,252
-[clicks]
-I was eight years old

434
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,796
when my father
first showed me his scars.

435
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,551
Each scar... tells a story,
and every story... leaves a scar.

436
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,220
[tires screech]

437
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,474
-[yelps] Holy crap!
-Diane, the show needs your help.

438
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:07,725
-What?
-You were right.

439
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,352
It's all the things you said it is,
but it doesn't have to be.

440
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:14,106
Come on as a consulting producer.
Work with Flip on the scripts,

441
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,358
make the show something
that we can all be proud of.

442
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,651
Why would I do that?

443
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:20,154
You said it yourself, more people
are going to watch this show

444
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,697
than read anything you write.

445
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:24,825
I'm giving you the opportunity
to change society for the better.

446
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:28,871
-Nothing I do changes anything.
-No? You changed me.

448
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:36,629

452
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:45,095
Yeah, I read about him this morning
in the metro section.

453
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,264
He just won a special election, right?

454
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:49,600
-Maybe so, but I--
-[bartender] Wow!

455
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,644
Thank you, sir, for keeping us informed

456
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,772
about the comings and goings
of our city politic.

457
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:59,401
After all, a democracy is only as strong
as its populace is informed.

458
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:00,986
No, no, no, I was trying to--

459
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,864
Hey, let's cheer once
for this kind stranger!

460
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:06,367
-Hip! Hip!
-[patrons] Hurray!

I guess Princess Carolyn was right.
Huh, Todd? Todd?

462
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:15,209
So, I guess the toughest thing of all
was being tough.

-Who are you talking to?
-Estelle.

464
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,421
-Who's Estelle?
-Just Estelle. You don't know her.

465
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:22,132
Not everybody needs to know everybody.

466
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:25,135
Hmm. I have learned two lessons, today.

467
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,306
We still need to cast Philbert's partner.

468
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,351
No more bad boys.
We can't take another PR hit.

469
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:36,438
We need an actor who everybody loves.
Someone almost annoyingly positive.

470
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:39,358
Enthusiastic with zero baggage.

471

[phone beeping, meowing]

472
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:44,196
You know who would be perfect?

473
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,574
Uh...

474
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:49,076
Hey, Flip! Diane.

475
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:52,454
Yeah, you're the lady who's gonna make
my show less sexist, right?

476
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:55,249
-Well, I'll see what I can do.
-Here's what I need.

477
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:59,420
Sit in my office, don't chew too loud,
and collect your paycheck.

478
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:00,880
Then, when the show comes out,

479
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:03,048
people will see your name
in the credits and say,

480
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:07,011
"Huh, a lady worked on the show.
Guess it's not sexist."

481
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,847
-I can contribute more than that.
-Not necessary.

482
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:14,143
Hey, thanks for being here.
You're really making a difference.

483
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,978
Uh...

484
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,108
[door closes]

485
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:24,320
-Hello, Diane.
-[shouts] Jesus Christ!

486
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,821
I locked the doors this time!

487
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:28,699
I broke your window,
because I needed to talk to you.

488
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:31,827
-I have a phone!
-You were right about Vance.

489
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:35,831
He just got fired off his new movie
after a drunken rant about the Chinese,

490
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:39,752
and then plowed his Hummer into the side
of the Grauman's Egyptian Theatre.

491
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,422
-Not the... Chinese Theatre?
-Mhm.

492
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:47,384
Anyway, his career is over,
for about two or three years,

493
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:49,178
-and then he'll be fine again.
-Yeah.

494
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,932
Listen, I'm sorry, the last time I saw you
I made things kind of personal.

495
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:56,101
No, no. You were right.
We give these men cover.

496
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:57,436
And if we give them cover,

497
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,605
we should know
exactly what they're capable of.

498
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,566
In fact,
I wanted to share this with you...

499
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,777
-woman to woman.
-[clicks]

500
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,655
[BoJack's voice] <i>She just walked in</i>
<i>at the worst possible...</i>

501
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:11,283
<i>-It wasn't my fault... right?</i>
-What is this?

502
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,744
<i>-[woman] ...what you're talking about.</i>
-[BoJack] <i>On the boat.</i>

503
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,120
<i>There was a girl.</i>

504
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,414
<i>-What?</i>
<i>-In New Mexico.</i>

505
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:20,125
<i>-And she trusted me.</i>
-Wha...?

506
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:21,585
<i>I keep asking myself,</i>

507
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:24,588
<i>if her mother didn't walk in,</i>
<i>would I have done it?</i>

508
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:27,341
<i>And part of me is sure</i>
<i>that I... I couldn't.</i>

509
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:31,178
<i>But another part knows that's a lie.</i>

510
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,097
<i>How do you make it right</i>

511
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,474
<i>when you've made it so wrong,</i>
<i>you can never go back?</i>

512
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:41,730
