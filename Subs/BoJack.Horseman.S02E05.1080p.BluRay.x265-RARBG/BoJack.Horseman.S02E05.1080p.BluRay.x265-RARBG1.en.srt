1
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,093
Son, did you do your homework?

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,262
I don't wanna do my homework!

3
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,889
What, what, what?

4
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:16,225
- I want chicken 4 dayz!
- 0h...

5
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,018
J“ oh, it's chicken 4 dayz! J“

6
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,436
j“ it's chicken 4 dayz! J“

7
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:22,314
j“ everybody's having fun
at chicken 4 dayz! J'

8
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:24,691
- I got a drumstick!
- I got a arm.

9
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:26,985
I got a bucket full of mystery stuff!

10
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,613
J' chicken-4-dayzy, totally crazy! I

11
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:32,407
j' don't ask questions,
just keep eating! J"

12
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,285
over at chicken 4 dayz,

13
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,329
they pump their chickens
full of hormones

14
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:40,666
and keep them cooped up
in tiny cages.

15
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,669
Now, as a chicken, this concerns me.

16
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:46,547
Here at gentle farms,
we treat our livestock differently.

17
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,590
Lush fields, plenty of dignity,

18
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:51,176
and foosball.

19
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:53,554
The chickens here
have wonderful lives

20
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,306
before we harvest them,
so you can eat them.

21
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,642
But wait, pa, aren't we chickens?

22
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,269
I don't wanna get eaten!

23
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,354
Boy, these animals aren't like us.

24
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,273
They're specifically bred to be eaten,

25
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,818
and genetically modified
for maximum flavor.

26
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:11,405
When our chicks hatch,
we lovingly inject them

27
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,907
with natural delicious hormones,

28
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:18,120
which makes them meat,
thereby erasing any moral gray area!

29
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:20,372
Now you can feel good
about eating our meat.

30
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:24,501
It's simple:
No one knows chicken like chickens.

31
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:25,877
Gentle farms.

32
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,799
Why put the "skip ad" button so late?
I'm not skipping now. I'm invested.

33
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:33,510
Bojack, you're driving a car right now.

34
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,137
- Oh, right!
- Aah! Oh!

35
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:36,388
Whoa!

36
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,551
Kelsey, ray of sunshine.

37
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,679
And who's this little drop of Jupiter?

38
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,848
- This is my daughter, Irving.
- Your daughter's name is Irving?

39
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,725
Gender-normative names
are oppressive.

40
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,602
Well, aren't you a little Princess?

41
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,604
What are you doing
outside of the castle?

42
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,356
Mom, your friend is being weird.

43
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,483
Bojack is not my friend.

44
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,860
- Whoa!
- Diane, I need you to handle Irving.

45
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,446
- Handle her?
- It's take your daughter to work day.

46
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,740
I took my daughter to work,
she got empowered,

47
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,702
and now I need you
to take my daughter away from work,

48
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,328
so I can actually do some.

49
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:25,288
Mom,
don't pawn me off onto your assistant.

50
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,124
Can you not fight me on this,
please?

51
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,961
Take my car and my daughter,
and go do whatever it is you do.

52
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:33,463
Way to delegate, captain!
Down low!

53
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,674
Nope? Look down.
Just put your eyes down.

54
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,926
My hand is below your eye line. No?

55
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,303
I guess you're stuck with me, kiddo.

56
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,807
Sounds great, old-woman-o.

57
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,935
What is it, bojack?
I'm at my dumb niece's wedding.

58
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,980
Not you, honey!
A different dumb niece.

59
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,773
I feel like Kelsey doesn't like me.

60
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,109
You're not really the kind of person
people like.

61
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,570
- Right away?
- Uh, sure.

62
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,739
But once they get to know me,
they adore me?

63
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,532
How do I put this delicately? No.

64
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:03,160
The problem is we haven't gotten
any one-on-one time.

65
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,995
There are always other people around.

66
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:06,747
Filming me. Feeding me.

67
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,498
Walking me to the garage at night,

68
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,209
because one time I saw a bag
in the wind and I got spooked.

69
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,754
Bojack, the only reason
you want Kelsey to like you

70
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,547
is because she's cold and distant.

71
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:18,216
Any time someone tries to love you,
you shove them away.

72
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,969
What? No, I don't, stupid.
You're stupid.

73
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,138
Don't be such a dumb stupid idiot,
Todd.

74
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,141
Okay, I gotta go.
Everyone's staring at me for some reason.

75
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:29,102
What? I'm ready.
Let's take a picture.

76
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,105
Hear ye! Hear ye!

77
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:35,901
I call this meeting
of p.B. Livin' to order.

78
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,820
I believe it was Benjamin Franklin
who said:

79
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,573
"You have reached the end
of your free trial membership

80
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,784
at Benjamin-Franklin-quotes.Com."

81
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,453
- What a wise man.
- What's on the agenda, my frienda?

82
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,580
Well, here's an idea.

83
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:52,125
What if there was a west Dakota?

84
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:55,003
Todd, isn't that a job
for the state department?

85
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,172
Well, I got a whole page
of other ideas,

86
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,801
each as impractical
as they are prohibitively expensive.

87
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:01,968
You know what they say:

88
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,887
"You gotta spend money
to make money.“

89
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,181
so, how can I spend a lot of money?

90
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,808
I know. I'll take a spa day.

91
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,851
- Uh...
- Eyes, prepare to receive cucumbers.

92
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,103
- We're in a meeting.
- You know what they say:

93
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,232
"You gotta skip meetings
to have meetings." See you.

94
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,776
- Wait, what should I do?
- I don't know.

95
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:20,904
Oh, maybe you could go
on one of your silly Todd adventures.

96
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,740
You know, whatever you do
when everyone is busy with other stuff.

97
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,951
Okay.

98
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,745
What is it, Todd?

99
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,747
Princess Carolyn,
I need something to do.

100
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,999
A job, or a task,
or a direction in life...

101
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,210
You're my agent.
Can you give my life meaning?

102
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:36,837
I don't have time for this.

103
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,714
Well, don't stop on my account.

104
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,175
Princess Carolyn,
do I have a purpose?

105
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,553
Oh, purpose? Are you high?

106
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:45,971
Only the normal amount.

107
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,473
I gotta go.
They're about to step on the glass.

108
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,809
Just stay out of trouble.

109
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,938
Uh, okay.

110
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,069
What I want is a hard target search

111
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:04,865
of every gas station, backyard,
outhouse, pool house...

112
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,825
And can I get a black-and-white cookie,

113
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,869
if it's not too g.D. Troublesome?

114
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,872
So, we know
the chicken crossed the road.

115
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:17,168
But the real mystery is why?

116
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,089
So, what do you want to be
when you grow up?

117
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:22,584
First I'm gonna go to brown,

118
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,426
- then I'm gonna go to Yale law.
- Wow.

119
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:26,970
Then I'm gonna be
the youngest supreme court justice.

120
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:30,599
- That's great.
- Or, you know, something in marketing.

121
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,017
Wow.

122
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,185
Would you mind
if we stopped by my house?

123
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,562
I have to do laundry.

124
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:39,024
So, you just, like, do laundry?
That's, like, your thing?

125
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,568
Okay.
This whole attitude you're putting on?

126
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:42,819
I must be Shania twain,

127
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,696
because that don't impress me much.

128
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,740
Is that a reference from the '905?

129
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,326
You know that was 20 years ago, right?

130
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,203
Hey, I was just like you
when I was a teenager.

131
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,706
I was this badass overachiever

132
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:57,292
that had these big plans
to change the world.

133
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,502
Yeah? What happened?

134
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,505
Oh, you didn't hear?
I changed the world.

135
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,721
Did you have a nice shower?

136
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,891
I made you a sandwich.
Oh, but it has Turkey in it.

137
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,058
Is that kind of weird?

138
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:16,852
Police!

139
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,148
Oh, man.

140
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,068
What seems to be the problem,
officer...?

141
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,904
Fuzzyface. Meow meow fuzzyface.

142
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,198
A chicken 4 dayz chicken
fell off a truck,

143
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,951
and I gotta find her
and take her to the slaughterhouse.

144
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,078
You haven't seen any chickens
running around?

145
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,663
No, I don't think so.

146
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:40,794
- Who's this?
- Uh, this is my, uh... my wife...

147
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,505
Becca! Yeah, my wife Becca.

148
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,715
- Becca Chavez. There she is.
- Okay.

149
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,884
Yep, she loves her books.

150
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,511
Big reader.

151
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,012
Real nerd.

152
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,848
Back off? Okay, I'm sorry, honey.

153
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,184
Hold on, if you're really a nerd,

154
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,603
who's your favorite
baroque composer?

155
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,899
Bach? Not Vivaldi? You're insane!

156
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,818
Yes, I am holding a bic pen,

157
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,237
but I don't see how that's relevant,
Mrs. Chavez.

158
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,947
Sorry. Becca.

159
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:12,075
She's a charming woman.

160
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,745
I do have to look around a little bit,
just so I can say I did my job.

161
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,790
- Uh, don't you need a warrant?
- Only if you're guilty.

162
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:27,674
Well, in that case,
mi casa es su casa.

163
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:34,222
So, if anyone asks,
you were born in la jolla.

164
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,474
You majored in communications at usc,

165
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,476
and now you're the booking agent

166
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:39,978
for kings of Leon.

167
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,772
- Fine, you also book Beck.
- Todd?

168
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,858
Aah! I didn't find that thing
in your drawer!

169
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,818
Why are the police outside?

170
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:50,030
Okay. I met this chicken and she escaped
from chicken 4 dayz factory,

171
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,614
and she doesn't speak English,

172
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,451
but she's my best friend
and the cops are looking for her,

173
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,097
and Mr. Peanutbutter went to the spa,

174
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,872
and I love her,
and her name is Becca. Chickenson.

175
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,666
- Todd, breathe.
- But we can't send Becca back.

176
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,627
They're gonna pump her full of hormones.

177
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,172
More hormones.

178
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,841
I have a plan,
but we gotta get her out of here now.

179
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:13,470
- Todd, no. Becca doesn't belong to you.
- But she needs our help.

180
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,513
Do you know
how much trouble we'd get in?

181
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,557
There's a policeman
in our front yard.

182
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,143
Uh-oh, here comes
the responsible suburban housewife.

183
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,645
Gonna do whatever the man says.

184
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,483
You're right. Let's get out of here.

185
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:30,195
So, now you're just gonna do
whatever a teenage girl says?

186
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,572
Jeezy kableezy, grow a spine.

187
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:33,990
Yeah, or a backbone.

188
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,157
Thank you, Becca.

189
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,538
Here chicken, chicken, chicken.

190
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:44,042
Oh, oh. Well, we're off to the beach.

191
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:47,545
Just me and my wife,
and our teenage daughter and our maid.

192
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,215
- What? Why am I a maid?
- Silence, maid!

193
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,634
Honey, do you want to sit in the front
or the back?

194
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:55,887
And why not? Maid, you can drive.

195
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,807
Hope there's not too much traffic
on the 134.

196
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,642
Okay, bye-bye, officer.

197
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,144
So long. Have a great day.

198
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,439
Wait a second.
The 134 doesn't go to the beach.

199
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,066
Unless you took it to the 10.

200
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,944
But then why wouldn't you
take the 405 to the 10?

201
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,071
Hold on, this pen isn't a bic.

202
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,907
No, no, this doesn't add up at all.

203
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:19,035
Wait! That man's wife was a...

204
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:22,705
Chicken!

205
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:27,961
Fowl run afoul.
A funky chicken has flown the Coop,

206
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:31,172
and for a concerned populace,
the sky is falling.

207
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,424
Michael Morgan,
chicken 4 dayz ceo,

208
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,178
this is a public safety hazard,
and your company is responsible.

209
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,140
Admit it, you counted your chickens
before they hatched,

210
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,851
and now,
those chickens have come home to roost.

211
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:46,187
Tom, I want to take full responsibility
for this mishap.

212
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,481
That's why,
for a limited time, everybody,

213
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:53,153
we are offering
our special full responsibility poppers

214
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,114
at participating restaurants
for only 4.99.

215
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,532
Tell me, though, if one sees

216
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,951
this delicious escaped chicken
in the street,

217
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,703
should they approach it, or...?

218
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,998
Oh, no. I want to be very clear
that this is not like a friend chicken

219
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,416
you see at school or work.

220
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,501
This is a special kind of food chicken

221
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,129
that has lived its entire life indoors.

222
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,923
This chicken is not socialized
for the outside world.

223
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,968
Sounds like my ex-wife. Hey ho!

224
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,261
Oh, Tommy.

225
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:21,389
Look, the safest place
for this chicken right now is with us,

226
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,933
so we can kill it,
turn it into a sludge,

227
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,895
and then press that sludge
into a delicious Patty.

228
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,063
I'd like to take this moment
to apologize

229
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,399
for the earlier crack
about my ex-wife.

230
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:35,445
Shannon,
we shared 14 beautiful years together.

231
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,530
How do you respond to allegations

232
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:41,034
that factory farming
is “torture," or "cruel,"

233
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:44,746
or "like a terrifying movie
about some strange dystopian society,

234
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:47,457
but in this monster story,
the horrifying monsters are us"?

235
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,000
Relax, Tommy,

236
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:53,129
everything we do
is completely legal and fda-approved,

237
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,298
so, therefore it is fine.

238
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:58,009
I have no follow-up questions.

239
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,889
- Okay, Todd, what's your plan?
- What?

240
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,390
You said you had a plan.

241
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,393
Oh, yeah. My plan was:
Ask Diane for help.

242
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,896
And now my plan has been completed.

243
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,522
Nice follow-through, Todd.

244
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,399
We have a 'roided out chicken

245
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,568
and the cops on the lookout.
What do we do?

246
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,196
Hey geniuses,
why don't we take her to gentle farms?

247
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:21,658
Yeah,
no one knows chicken like chickens!

248
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,994
They couldn't say that in the ad
if it wasn't true.

249
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,248
Yeah! Book Beck. You remember.

250
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,879
- And cut! Company move to...
- Great news, blue-collar types.

251
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:37,882
Instead of crew lunch today,
your star has arranged

252
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,134
for his favorite burrito truck
to bring you lunch.

253
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:42,804
It's me, I'm that star!

254
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,099
Bojack we are not breaking for lunch yet.

255
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,558
Or we could break for lunch,

256
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,644
and you and I
could get to know each other.

257
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,187
The crew has more work to do.

258
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:54,034
Once they've had a burrito,
they'll be off their circadian rhythm...

259
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,150
- What?
- Los Angeles p.D.

260
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,278
Are you the owner of a 2002 Volvo

261
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,363
with a "reelect al Gore"
bumper sticker?

262
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,115
As relevant today as it was then.

263
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,618
Are you aware said Volvo
is currently harboring a fugitive chicken,

264
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:09,163
along with a teenage girl,
a small, sprite-like man,

265
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,915
and a maid of some sort?

266
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:13,376
That's my daughter!
Not the maid. The other one.

267
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:16,004
I'd wager they're making a run
for gentle farms.

268
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,422
Don't worry, though.

269
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,300
We'll bring your daughter home,
dead or alive.

270
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,468
- Alive! Alive!
- We're the I.A.P.D., ma'am.

271
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,346
- We'll probably make the right call.
- Wait, wait, wait...

272
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,015
All right, troops, listen up!

273
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,434
I'm ready to go after these rabble-rousers
with all...

274
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,312
Oh, no! Not until you get a warrant!

275
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,980
Ah, damn it, I hate due process!

276
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,190
You're a loose Cannon,
meow meow fuzzyface.

277
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,402
No, I'm not. I'm a Cannon, maybe,
but a loose Cannon?

278
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:40,987
Is that what you think of me?

279
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,530
I think you play
by your own rules.

280
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:45,074
No way,
he thinks rules were made to be broken.

281
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,493
These are all attributes
of a loose Cannon.

282
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,495
No, I'm just a reckless renegade.

283
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,581
- Sergeant stone's a loose Cannon.
- Aah!

284
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,083
You shut your trap, fuzzyface.

285
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,503
I'd say stone's more of a cop on the edge
with nothing to lose.

286
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,298
- That's a different thing.
- Now I'm just confused.

287
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,717
Is meow meow fuzzyface
a loose Cannon or not?

288
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,677
All right, put on a pot of coffee.

289
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,263
We're gonna get to the bottom of this.

290
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,141
Aw, man.

291
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:13,853
So full of burrito. Ooh.

292
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,730
Uh-oh, siesta time.

293
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:19,609
I need to 90. Irving ran off
with a fugitive chicken in my car.

294
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,402
We can take my car.
This is perfect.

295
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,821
Why is this perfect?
My daughter could be in danger.

296
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:27,241
Yes, I agree, but we can use the car ride
to get some one-on-one.

297
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,035
I mean, who is bojack?

298
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,828
I'm sure I can find another ride.

299
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,289
Every second you waste
finding another ride,

300
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:37,001
your daughter gets closer to getting
her eyes poked out by a mutant chicken,

301
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,754
or worse, death,
or slightly better, teen pregnancy,

302
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,589
or worse again, salmonella.

303
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:42,965
Okay, fine. Let's go.

304
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,301
Yay! I'm calling this road trip the 007,

305
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:46,761
because we are gonna bond.

306
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:49,555
Up top? Down low?
Either one? Both?

307
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,975
Oh, wow,
you guys have a movie night here?

308
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,937
- Oh...
- And we have 20 acres of pasture,

309
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,606
where our chickens have hours
of free play.

310
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,483
See, Todd? She'll be happy here.

311
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,901
She sure will.

312
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:05,405
Because no one knows chicken
like chickens.

313
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:09,242
Thank you for saving this poultry
from a terrible life at a factory farm.

314
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,451
You're a hero.

315
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,413
But what if chicken 4 dayz
tries to get her back?

316
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,331
Don't you worry about your friend.

317
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,917
- That chicken belongs to us now.
- Whoa!

318
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:21,254
- Where'd you get that gun?
- You mean originally, or just now?

319
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,922
- Just now.
- It was in that barrel.

320
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,591
- And what about originally?
- Also that barrel.

321
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,469
Look, Becca,
I know this is hard to understand,

322
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,805
but I have to go,
and you can't come with me.

323
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:34,809
No, no,
you don't need to book Beck anymore.

324
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:36,978
Now you can just be a chicken.

325
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,897
See, this is where you belong, okay?

326
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,899
You hear me?
I don't want you no more.

327
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,318
You weren't the best friend I ever had,

328
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:48,364
and I never loved you!
Now get, Becca!

329
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,283
I said get!

330
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,789
She really stretched out that dress.

331
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,667
She was so horrified,
she checked into rehab.

332
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,295
So, I'm kind of the reason
drew Barrymore got sober.

333
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:05,006
Did you like never been kissed?
If so, you're welcome.

334
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,425
Can we have one conversation
that isn't about you?

335
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,760
I don't understand
why you need me to like you.

336
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:13,139
I don't need you to like me.
It would be fun if you liked me,

337
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,017
because I'd prove my parents were wrong
to never support me,

338
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:18,519
because I earned the admiration
of an authority figure,

339
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,146
proving I have intrinsic worth,

340
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,190
but it's not a big deal or anything.
Jeez.

341
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:25,443
Great story. You should put that
in a podcast, so I can unsubscribe.

342
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,361
Can this piece of junk go any faster?

343
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,072
It's been screwy since I hit that deer
a couple weeks back.

344
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,639
Probably should get it checked out.

345
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,165
Probably should've gotten it checked out.

346
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,630
- Those farmers seem nice.
- Yeah.

347
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,174
I think Becca will be really happy there.

348
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,759
She'll have a nice life.

349
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,762
Yeah, until they kill her.

350
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,390
Well, yeah, but of all the places
that will eventually kill her,

351
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,726
gentle farms seems like the best.

352
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,603
This doesn't feel right.

353
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,563
Becca was our friend.

354
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,483
- No. We gotta get her back.
- Uh, what do you mean?

355
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,490
Remember when that guy
cocked his gun and said:

356
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:09,237
"That chicken belongs to us now"?

357
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:12,073
He wasn't doing that
because he likes cocking guns.

358
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,201
- Then we'll just bust her out.
- Todd, there's nothing we can do.

359
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,786
Where else would Becca go?

360
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,454
She doesn't even speak English.

361
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,248
Well, we gotta do something.

362
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,125
Look, I know I'm a screw-up
and all my ideas are terrible,

363
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,796
but with Becca,
I was responsible for something.

364
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,631
I had a purpose.

365
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:32,510
Ah. I guess you wouldn't understand.

366
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:40,059
- Oh, my god, Diane!
- All right. Let's bust her out.

367
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,770
Yes! Okay, and afterwards,
will you get me an iPad?

368
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,773
- What? No.
- But I really want an iPad.

369
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,693
Maybe you wouldn't understand.

370
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,069
Don't push it.

371
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:56,325
All right, all right, we've agreed.
He's a loose Cannon, but he gets results.

372
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,078
- I can live with that.
- Now, you go bust those perps.

373
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,205
You'll need a Maverick,
a by-the-book rookie,

374
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:04,125
and a curmudgeonly veteran
one week from retirement.

375
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:05,292
Go, go, go!

376
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,673
We have received word that authorities
are now en route to gentle farms

377
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:14,802
in an attempt to preempt
the pursued poultry at the pass.

378
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,471
Do we have a graphic for this? No?
Where's the graphic?

379
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,141
No, I'm not gonna go on
until we have a graphic.

380
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,560
So, make one. I'll wait.
Yeah, hold on, america,

381
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:25,104
Randy's gotta figure out
how to do his job.

382
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,232
Because if I don't have a graphic,
Randy,

383
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,109
people who are just tuning in...

384
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:33,029
Why am I explaining this to you?
This is basic journalistic...

385
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:36,407
I swear to god! We'll be right back!

386
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:42,580
Just got to place the Jack
in the right Jack apparatus.

387
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,165
There, I have got...

388
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:45,791
No. I have no idea what I'm doing.

389
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,461
That was me acting.
Pretty convincing performance, huh?

390
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:49,670
There's more to me...

391
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,672
Are you capable
of experiencing a moment

392
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,466
that you don't then make about you?

393
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,301
What was your plan
to get out of here?

394
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,011
I don't know. Some hick will come by,

395
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:59,013
and I'll give him an autograph
for a tow.

396
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,557
Boom, his life's changed,
and you and I are on our way.

397
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:05,186
Oh, my god.
I'm going to lose custody of my daughter.

398
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:07,521
The only reason I took this movie
is for her.

399
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,649
This is my one shot
at a big studio movie.

400
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,985
If I blow it, I'm back to making small,
critically acclaimed movies

401
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,820
about lesbians learning how to recycle.

402
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,031
You think I want to be an indie darling?

403
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:18,783
Who's gonna fund Irving's education?

404
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,787
- Marla? With her seasonal nut butters?
- Yeah, Marla sucks, right?

405
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,331
Indie-darling daughters
don't go to brown, okay?

406
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,376
They end up at cute
pat-on-the-back factories like vassar,

407
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,753
then move back in
with their indie-darling mothers

408
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,755
and make puppet shows
with their tampons,

409
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,007
and they get a profile
in New York magazine,

410
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,384
and the cycle continues.

411
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,678
Oh, my god, I'm a terrible mother.

412
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,055
Hey, I know terrible mothers,

413
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:43,683
and you're not a terrible mother.

414
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:47,019
Hey, aren't you the horse
from horsin' around?

415
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,229
And you're the director

416
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:50,815
of women who love women
who love recycling.

417
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,818
Give you a lift
in exchange for a couple autographs.

418
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,028
There he is. Right on time.

419
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,243
Shh, shh, shh.

420
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,787
Everyone keep quiet. We gotta...

421
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:07,415
Ooh. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

422
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,715
They probably didn't hear that.

423
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,175
Uh, that's probably a coincidence.

424
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,969
Someone broke onto the farm!

425
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,346
Maybe they're rehearsing a one-act play

426
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:24,056
called someone broke onto the farm

427
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:25,992
and someone just said the titular line?

428
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:27,934
This way.

429
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,438
- Oh.
- Irving, this isn't safe.

430
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:31,832
Get in the car, lock the doors.

431
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,649
Don't be a badass
and argue with me...

432
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:35,317
- Yeah, okay, bye!
- Okay.

433
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,486
Go, go, go!

434
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:43,367
Becca?

435
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,996
Who's making that ruckus
in my chicken Coop?

436
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,417
- Becca, where are you?
- Becca, are you...?

437
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,335
Becca?

438
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:54,670
Is this you?

439
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,714
Becca?

440
00:20:56,881 --> 00:21:00,509
To... to... Todd?

441
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:03,095
Oh, I found her! Diane!
This one's Becca!

442
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,347
No! Todd! Don't you get it?

443
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,017
- They're all Becca.
- Oh.

444
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,644
Okay, go, chickens! You're free.

445
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,229
Go, run to freedom!

446
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,648
For generations
they will tell your story!

447
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,942
- Who goes there?
- Oh, oh, oh, shit!

448
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,736
- We gotta hide!
- Go, go, go!

449
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:21,572
Hide, hide! In here!
Some place safe.

450
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,616
Come on, come on. Oh, no!

451
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:31,123
- Shh, shh. Becca, no, no, no!
- Shh.

452
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,293
Only we know how to care
for these creatures, you hear?

453
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,714
Like I say:
No one knows chicken like chickens.

454
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:45,304
- Diane, I'm sorry I got you into this.
- It's not your fault.

455
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,681
I don't know why
I always get into these messes.

456
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,601
You know,
sometimes I feel like my whole life

457
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:54,021
is just a series
of loosely-related wacky misadventures.

458
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:57,983
I think
that's just what being in your 205 is.

459
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,777
- Really?
- Yeah.

460
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:02,780
I'm supposed to be the adult here,
and I'm a total mess.

461
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,990
You kidding?
You're the coolest person I know.

462
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,159
- Really?
- Yeah. You always know what to do,

463
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,953
and you don't take shit from anyone.

464
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,579
Is that how you see me?

465
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,541
Of course. You're like Lara croft.

466
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,793
In Diane's body.

467
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:21,465
- This is our chance. Let's go!
- Come on!

468
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:22,632
Go, go, go!

469
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,553
Please. Take me with you.

470
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,930
I hate it here.
I don't want to kill chickens.

471
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:31,100
I want to design video games
that help kids learn math.

472
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:34,019
Whoa!

473
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,814
I am so sorry.

474
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,941
Okay, that was crazy! Just go.

475
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:41,110
Let's get out of here!

476
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,576
We're free, we're free! Oh, shit.

477
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:55,457
Well, well,
looks like birds of a feather

478
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,792
go to jail.

479
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:59,128
Why was he wearing sunglasses

480
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:00,546
at night?

481
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:05,551
I hope you folks like community service.

482
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,720
- I do.
- What? Oh.

483
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,055
Oh, my god, Irving,
thank god you're safe.

484
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,640
Mom, I'm fine.

485
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,018
Stop embarrassing me
in front of my cool friends.

486
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,103
What? Cool?

487
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:19,523
I mean,
that's cool that you think I'm cool.

488
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,276
I don't care or anything,
but, you know, it's cool.

489
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,612
Hey, this guy.
What'd you get arrested for?

490
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,447
Being too cute?

491
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:27,656
I want to be in his cell.

492
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:28,967
Listen up, everybody.

493
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:31,994
I, famous celebrity bojack horseman,
have an announcement.

494
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,996
I'm going to ask you to drop all charges

495
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:35,956
on account of me being a celebrity.

496
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,667
We gracefully accept
the requisite slap on the wrist

497
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,836
and a brief,
but ultimately pointless, trial

498
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:43,505
in the court of public opinion.
Good day.

499
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,800
Well, you are famous,
so you are all free to go.

500
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:50,262
- But what about Becca?
- Took care of that, too.

501
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,181
Called in a favor with drew Barrymore,

502
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:55,059
and she'll pay off chicken 4 dayz
to adopt your friend.

503
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:58,103
Does she have a Meadow
that Becca can frolic around in?

504
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,898
You think drew Barrymore
doesn't have a frolicking Meadow?

505
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:02,733
That is the dumbest thing I've heard.

506
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,485
I learned something today.

507
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:06,570
When you think
something isn't about you,

508
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:09,490
you find a way to save the day
and realize that it was,

509
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:11,784
all along, all about you.

510
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:15,079
Plus, I got you all a burrito truck!

511
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,498
- Hooray!
- Yay! I'm great!

512
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:24,046
So, after all that,
the only thing that saved Becca

513
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,548
was that bojack was friends
with drew Barrymore?

514
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,051
- Yep.
- So, did anything we did matter?

515
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:30,803
- Nope.
- I think it did.

516
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,680
I think we made a difference.

517
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,932
A small one, but a difference.

518
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,267
Yeah, I think we did, too.

519
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:40,813
I think we really changed things
for the better.

520
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,111
J' back in the '905 j'

521
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:52,950

526
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,515

to make you understand j“

527
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:20,728
j“ that I'm a horse and a man j"

528
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:24,940

530
