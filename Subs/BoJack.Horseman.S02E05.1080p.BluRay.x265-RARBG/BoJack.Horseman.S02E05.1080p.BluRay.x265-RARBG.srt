1
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,093
Son, did you do your homework?

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,262
I don't wanna do my homework!

3
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,889
What, what, what?

4
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:16,225
- I want chicken 4 dayz!
- 0h...

5
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,018
[Rapper] J“ oh, it's chicken 4 dayz! J“

6
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,436
j“ it's chicken 4 dayz! J“

7
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:22,314
j“ everybody's having fun
at chicken 4 dayz! J'

8
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:24,691
- I got a drumstick!
- I got a arm.

9
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:26,985
I got a bucket full of mystery stuff!

10
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,613
[Rapper]
J' chicken-4-dayzy, totally crazy! I

11
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:32,407
j' don't ask questions,
just keep eating! J"

12
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,285
over at chicken 4 dayz,

13
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,329
they pump their chickens
full of hormones

14
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:40,666
and keep them cooped up
in tiny cages.

15
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,669
Now, as a chicken, this concerns me.

16
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:46,547
Here at gentle farms,
we treat our livestock differently.

17
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,590
Lush fields, plenty of dignity,

18
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:51,176
and foosball. [Chuckles]

19
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:53,554
The chickens here
have wonderful lives

20
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,306
before we harvest them,
so you can eat them.

21
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,642
But wait, pa, aren't we chickens?

22
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,269
I don't wanna get eaten!

23
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,354
Boy, these animals aren't like us.

24
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,273
They're specifically bred to be eaten,

25
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,818
and genetically modified
for maximum flavor.

26
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:11,405
When our chicks hatch,
we lovingly inject them

27
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,907
with natural delicious hormones,

28
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:18,120
which makes them meat,
thereby erasing any moral gray area!

29
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:20,372
Now you can feel good
about eating our meat.

30
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:24,501
It's simple:
No one knows chicken like chickens.

31
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:25,877
Gentle farms.

32
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,799
Why put the "skip ad" button so late?
I'm not skipping now. I'm invested.

33
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:33,510
Bojack, you're driving a car right now.

34
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,137
- Oh, right!
- Aah! Oh!

35
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:36,388
[Bojack] Whoa!

36
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:39,433
[Tires screech, then crashing]

37
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:43,312
[Horn honks]

38
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:49,735
[Clucking]

39
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,340
[Cawing]

40
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,551
Kelsey, ray of sunshine.

41
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,679
And who's this little drop of Jupiter?

42
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,848
- This is my daughter, Irving.
- Your daughter's name is Irving?

43
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,725
Gender-normative names
are oppressive.

44
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,602
Well, aren't you a little Princess?

45
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,604
What are you doing
outside of the castle?

46
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,356
Mom, your friend is being weird.

47
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,483
Bojack is not my friend.

48
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,860
- Whoa!
- Diane, I need you to handle Irving.

49
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,446
- Handle her?
- It's take your daughter to work day.

50
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,740
I took my daughter to work,
she got empowered,

51
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,702
and now I need you
to take my daughter away from work,

52
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,328
so I can actually do some.

53
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:25,288
Mom,
don't pawn me off onto your assistant.

54
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,124
Can you not fight me on this,
please?

55
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,961
Take my car and my daughter,
and go do whatever it is you do.

56
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:33,463
Way to delegate, captain!
Down low!

57
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,674
Nope? Look down.
Just put your eyes down.

58
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,926
My hand is below your eye line. No?

59
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,303
I guess you're stuck with me, kiddo.

60
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,807
Sounds great, old-woman-o.

61
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:44,766
[Cell phone chirps]

62
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,935
What is it, bojack?
I'm at my dumb niece's wedding.

63
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,980
Not you, honey!
A different dumb niece.

64
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,773
I feel like Kelsey doesn't like me.

65
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,109
You're not really the kind of person
people like.

66
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,570
- Right away?
- Uh, sure.

67
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,739
But once they get to know me,
they adore me?

68
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,532
How do I put this delicately? No.

69
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:03,160
The problem is we haven't gotten
any one-on-one time.

70
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,995
There are always other people around.

71
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:06,747
Filming me. Feeding me.

72
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,498
Walking me to the garage at night,

73
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,209
because one time I saw a bag
in the wind and I got spooked.

74
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,754
Bojack, the only reason
you want Kelsey to like you

75
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,547
is because she's cold and distant.

76
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:18,216
Any time someone tries to love you,
you shove them away.

77
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,969
What? No, I don't, stupid.
You're stupid.

78
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,138
Don't be such a dumb stupid idiot,
Todd.

79
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,141
Okay, I gotta go.
Everyone's staring at me for some reason.

80
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:29,102
What? I'm ready.
Let's take a picture.

81
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,105
Hear ye! Hear ye!

82
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:35,901
I call this meeting
of p.B. Livin' to order.

83
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,820
I believe it was Benjamin Franklin
who said:

84
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,573
"You have reached the end
of your free trial membership

85
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,784
at Benjamin-Franklin-quotes.Com."

86
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,453
- What a wise man.
- What's on the agenda, my frienda?

87
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,580
Well, here's an idea.

88
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:52,125
What if there was a west Dakota?

89
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:55,003
Todd, isn't that a job
for the state department?

90
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,172
Well, I got a whole page
of other ideas,

91
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,801
each as impractical
as they are prohibitively expensive.

92
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:01,968
You know what they say:

93
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,887
"You gotta spend money
to make money.“

94
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,181
so, how can I spend a lot of money?

95
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,808
I know. I'll take a spa day.

96
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,851
- Uh...
- Eyes, prepare to receive cucumbers.

97
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,103
- We're in a meeting.
- You know what they say:

98
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,232
"You gotta skip meetings
to have meetings." See you.

99
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,776
- Wait, what should I do?
- I don't know.

100
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:20,904
Oh, maybe you could go
on one of your silly Todd adventures.

101
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,740
You know, whatever you do
when everyone is busy with other stuff.

102
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,951
[Sighs] Okay.

103
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,410
[Cell phone chirps]

104
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,745
What is it, Todd?

105
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,747
Princess Carolyn,
I need something to do.

106
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,999
A job, or a task,
or a direction in life...

107
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,210
You're my agent.
Can you give my life meaning?

108
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:36,837
I don't have time for this.

109
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,714
Well, don't stop on my account.

110
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,175
Princess Carolyn,
do I have a purpose?

111
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,553
Oh, purpose? Are you high?

112
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:45,971
Only the normal amount.

113
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,473
I gotta go.
They're about to step on the glass.

114
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,809
Just stay out of trouble.

115
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,435
[Clucks]

116
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,938
Uh, okay.

117
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,773
[Horn honks, then siren whoops]

118
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:58,858
[Sniffing]

119
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,069
What I want is a hard target search

120
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:04,865
of every gas station, backyard,
outhouse, pool house...

121
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,825
And can I get a black-and-white cookie,

122
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,869
if it's not too g.D. Troublesome?

123
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,872
So, we know
the chicken crossed the road.

124
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:17,168
But the real mystery is why?

125
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,089
So, what do you want to be
when you grow up?

126
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:22,584
First I'm gonna go to brown,

127
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,426
- then I'm gonna go to Yale law.
- Wow.

128
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:26,970
Then I'm gonna be
the youngest supreme court justice.

129
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:30,599
- That's great.
- Or, you know, something in marketing.

130
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,017
Wow.

131
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,185
Would you mind
if we stopped by my house?

132
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,562
I have to do laundry.

133
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:39,024
So, you just, like, do laundry?
That's, like, your thing?

134
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,568
Okay.
This whole attitude you're putting on?

135
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:42,819
I must be Shania twain,

136
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,696
because that don't impress me much.

137
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,740
Is that a reference from the '905?

138
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,326
You know that was 20 years ago, right?

139
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,203
Hey, I was just like you
when I was a teenager.

140
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,706
I was this badass overachiever

141
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:57,292
that had these big plans
to change the world.

142
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,502
Yeah? What happened?

143
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,505
Oh, you didn't hear?
I changed the world.

144
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:05,884
[Todd whistling]

146
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,721
Did you have a nice shower?

147
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,891
I made you a sandwich.
Oh, but it has Turkey in it.

148
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:13,850
Is that kind of weird?

149
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,685
[Becca clucks, then doorbell rings]

150
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:16,852

[Todd] Oh, man. [Sighs]

What seems to be the problem,
officer...?

154
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,904
Fuzzyface. Meow meow fuzzyface.

155
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,198
A chicken 4 dayz chicken
fell off a truck,

156
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,951
and I gotta find her
and take her to the slaughterhouse.

157
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,078
You haven't seen any chickens
running around?

158
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,663
No, I don't think so.

[Clucking]

160
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:40,794
- Who's this?
- Uh, this is my, uh... my wife...

161
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,505
- [Clucks]
- Becca! Yeah, my wife Becca.

162
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,715
- Becca Chavez. There she is.
- Okay.

163
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,884
- [Clucks]
- Yep, she loves her books.

164
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,511
Big reader. [Chuckles]

165
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,012
- Real nerd.
- [Clucks]

166
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,848
Back off? Okay, I'm sorry, honey.

167
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,184
Hold on, if you're really a nerd,

168
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,603
who's your favorite
baroque composer?

170

- Bach? Not Vivaldi? You're insane!

Yes, I am holding a bic pen,

172
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,237
but I don't see how that's relevant,
Mrs. Chavez.

173
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,947

- Sorry. Becca.

174
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:12,075
- [Becca clucking]
- She's a charming woman.

175
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,745
I do have to look around a little bit,
just so I can say I did my job.

176
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,790
- Uh, don't you need a warrant?
- Only if you're guilty.

177

[Both chuckling]

178
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:27,674
Well, in that case,
mi casa es su casa.

[Both chuckling]

180
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:34,222
So, if anyone asks,
you were born in la jolla.

181
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,474
You majored in communications at usc,

182
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,476
and now you're the booking agent

183
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:39,978
- for kings of Leon.
- [Clucks]

184
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,772
- Fine, you also book Beck.
- [Diane] Todd?

185
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,858
Aah! I didn't find that thing
in your drawer!

186
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,818
Why are the police outside?

187
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:50,030
Okay. I met this chicken and she escaped
from chicken 4 dayz factory,

188
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,614
and she doesn't speak English,

189
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,451
but she's my best friend
and the cops are looking for her,

190
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,097
and Mr. Peanutbutter went to the spa,

191
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,872
and I love her,
and her name is Becca. Chickenson.

192
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,666
- Todd, breathe.
- But we can't send Becca back.

193
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,627
- They're gonna pump her full of hormones.
- [Clucks]

194
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,172
- More hormones.
- [Clucking]

195
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,841
I have a plan,
but we gotta get her out of here now.

196
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:13,470
- Todd, no. Becca doesn't belong to you.
- But she needs our help.

197
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,513
Do you know
how much trouble we'd get in?

198
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,557
There's a policeman
in our front yard.

199
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,143
Uh-oh, here comes
the responsible suburban housewife.

200
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,645
Gonna do whatever the man says.

[Sighs]

202
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,483
You're right. Let's get out of here.

203
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:30,195
So, now you're just gonna do
whatever a teenage girl says?

204
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,572
- Jeezy kableezy, grow a spine.
- [Clucks]

205
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:33,990
Yeah, or a backbone.

206
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,157
Thank you, Becca.

Oh, oh. Well, we're off to the beach.

211
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:47,545
Just me and my wife,
and our teenage daughter and our maid.

212
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,215
- What? Why am I a maid?
- Silence, maid!

213
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,634
Honey, do you want to sit in the front
or the back?

214
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:55,887
- [Clucks]
- And why not? Maid, you can drive.

215
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,807
Hope there's not too much traffic
on the 134.

216
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,642
Okay, bye-bye, officer.

217
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,144
So long. Have a great day.

218
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,439
Wait a second.
The 134 doesn't go to the beach.

219
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,066
Unless you took it to the 10.

220
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,944
But then why wouldn't you
take the 405 to the 10?

221
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,071
Hold on, this pen isn't a bic.

222
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,907
No, no, this doesn't add up at all.

223
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:19,035
Wait! That man's wife was a...

224
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:22,705

Fowl run afoul.
A funky chicken has flown the Coop,

227
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:31,172
and for a concerned populace,
the sky is falling.

228
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,424
Michael Morgan,
chicken 4 dayz ceo,

229
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,178
this is a public safety hazard,
and your company is responsible.

230
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,140
Admit it, you counted your chickens
before they hatched,

231
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,851
and now,
those chickens have come home to roost.

232
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:46,187
Tom, I want to take full responsibility
for this mishap.

233
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,481
That's why,
for a limited time, everybody,

234
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:53,153
we are offering
our special full responsibility poppers

235
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,114
at participating restaurants
for only 4.99.

236
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,532
Tell me, though, if one sees

237
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,951
this delicious escaped chicken
in the street,

238
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,703
should they approach it, or...?

239
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,998
Oh, no. I want to be very clear
that this is not like a friend chicken

240
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,416
you see at school or work.

241
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,501
This is a special kind of food chicken

242

that has lived its entire life indoors.

243
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,923

for the outside world.

Oh, Tommy.

246
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:21,389
Look, the safest place
for this chicken right now is with us,

247
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,933
so we can kill it,
turn it into a sludge,

248
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,895
and then press that sludge
into a delicious Patty.

249
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,063
I'd like to take this moment
to apologize

250
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,399
for the earlier crack
about my ex-wife.

251

How do you respond to allegations

253
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:41,034
that factory farming
is “torture," or "cruel,"

254

about some strange dystopian society,

- What?

could get to know each other.

00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:05,405
[Both] Because no one knows chicken
like chickens.

338
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:09,242
Thank you for saving this poultry
from a terrible life at a factory farm.

339
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,451
You're a hero.

340
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,413
But what if chicken 4 dayz
tries to get her back?

341
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,331
Don't you worry about your friend.

342
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,917
- That chicken belongs to us now.
- [Diane] Whoa!

343
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:21,254
- Where'd you get that gun?
- You mean originally, or just now?

344
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,922
- Just now.
- It was in that barrel.

345
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,591
- And what about originally?
- Also that barrel.

346
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,469
Look, Becca,
I know this is hard to understand,

347
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,805
but I have to go,
and you can't come with me.

348
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:31,806
[Clucks]

349
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:34,809
No, no,
you don't need to book Beck anymore.

350
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:36,978
Now you can just be a chicken.

351
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,897
See, this is where you belong, okay?

352
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,899
You hear me?
I don't want you no more.

353
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,318
You weren't the best friend I ever had,

354
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:48,364
and I never loved you!
Now get, Becca!

355
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,283
I said get!

356
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,868
[Sobbing]

357
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,995
[Becca clucking]

358
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,789
She really stretched out that dress.

359
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,667
She was so horrified,
she checked into rehab.

360
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,295
So, I'm kind of the reason
drew Barrymore got sober.

361
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:05,006
Did you like never been kissed?
If so, you're welcome.

362
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,425
Can we have one conversation
that isn't about you?

363
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,760
I don't understand
why you need me to like you.

364
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:13,139
I don't need you to like me.
It would be fun if you liked me,

365
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,017
because I'd prove my parents were wrong
to never support me,

366
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:18,519
because I earned the admiration
of an authority figure,

367
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,146
proving I have intrinsic worth,

368
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,190
but it's not a big deal or anything.
Jeez.

369
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:25,443
Great story. You should put that
in a podcast, so I can unsubscribe.

370
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,361
Can this piece of junk go any faster?

371
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,072
It's been screwy since I hit that deer
a couple weeks back.

372
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,550
Probably should get it checked out.

373
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:32,366
[Tire blows]

374
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,619
[Both yelling]

375
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,121
[Sighs]

376
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,165
Probably should've gotten it checked out.

377
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,630
- Those farmers seem nice.
- Yeah.

378
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,174
I think Becca will be really happy there.

379
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,759
She'll have a nice life.

380
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,762
Yeah, until they kill her.

381
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,390
Well, yeah, but of all the places
that will eventually kill her,

382
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,726
gentle farms seems like the best.

383
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,603
This doesn't feel right.

384
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,563
Becca was our friend.

385
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,483
- No. We gotta get her back.
- Uh, what do you mean?

386
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,490
Remember when that guy
cocked his gun and said:

387
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:09,237
"That chicken belongs to us now"?

388
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:12,073
He wasn't doing that
because he likes cocking guns.

389
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,201
- Then we'll just bust her out.
- Todd, there's nothing we can do.

390
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,786
Where else would Becca go?

391
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,454
She doesn't even speak English.

392
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,248
Well, we gotta do something.

393
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,125
Look, I know I'm a screw-up
and all my ideas are terrible,

394
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,796
but with Becca,
I was responsible for something.

395
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,631
I had a purpose.

396
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:32,510
Ah. I guess you wouldn't understand.

397
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,137
[Groans]

398
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,199
[Tires screeching,
then and Irving and bojack yell]

399
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:40,059
- Oh, my god, Diane!
- All right. Let's bust her out.

400
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,770
Yes! Okay, and afterwards,
will you get me an iPad?

401
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,773
- What? No.
- But I really want an iPad.

402
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,693
Maybe you wouldn't understand.

403
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,069
Don't push it.

404
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:56,325
All right, all right, we've agreed.
He's a loose Cannon, but he gets results.

405
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,078
- I can live with that.
- Now, you go bust those perps.

406
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,205
You'll need a Maverick,
a by-the-book rookie,

407
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:04,125
and a curmudgeonly veteran
one week from retirement.

408
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:05,292
Go, go, go!

409
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:06,168
[Men speaking indistinctly]

410
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,335
[News theme music plays]

411
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,673
We have received word that authorities
are now en route to gentle farms

412
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:14,802
in an attempt to preempt
the pursued poultry at the pass.

413
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,471
Do we have a graphic for this? No?
Where's the graphic?

414
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,141
No, I'm not gonna go on
until we have a graphic.

415
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,560
So, make one. I'll wait.
Yeah, hold on, america,

416
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:25,104
Randy's gotta figure out
how to do his job.

417
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,232
Because if I don't have a graphic,
Randy,

418
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,109
people who are just tuning in...

419
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:33,029
Why am I explaining this to you?
This is basic journalistic...

420
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:36,407
I swear to god! We'll be right back!

421
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:42,580
Just got to place the Jack
in the right Jack apparatus.

422
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,165
There, I have got...

423
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:45,791
No. I have no idea what I'm doing.

424
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,461
That was me acting.
Pretty convincing performance, huh?

425
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:49,670
There's more to me...

426
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,672
Are you capable
of experiencing a moment

427
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,466
that you don't then make about you?

428
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,301
What was your plan
to get out of here?

429
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,011
I don't know. Some hick will come by,

430
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:59,013
and I'll give him an autograph
for a tow.

431
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,557
Boom, his life's changed,
and you and I are on our way.

432
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:05,186
Oh, my god.
I'm going to lose custody of my daughter.

433
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:07,521
The only reason I took this movie
is for her.

434
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,649
This is my one shot
at a big studio movie.

435
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,985
If I blow it, I'm back to making small,
critically acclaimed movies

436
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,820
about lesbians learning how to recycle.

437
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,031
You think I want to be an indie darling?

438
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:18,783
Who's gonna fund Irving's education?

439
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,787
- Marla? With her seasonal nut butters?
- Yeah, Marla sucks, right?

440
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,331
Indie-darling daughters
don't go to brown, okay?

441
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,376
They end up at cute
pat-on-the-back factories like vassar,

442
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,753
then move back in
with their indie-darling mothers

443
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,755
and make puppet shows
with their tampons,

444
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,007
and they get a profile
in New York magazine,

445
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,384
and the cycle continues.

446
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,678
Oh, my god, I'm a terrible mother.

447
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,055
Hey, I know terrible mothers,

448
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:43,683
and you're not a terrible mother.

Hey, aren't you the horse
from horsin' around?

450

And you're the director

who love recycling.

in exchange for a couple autographs.

[Gong sounds]

460
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,715
They probably didn't hear that.

461
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,175
Uh, that's probably a coincidence.

462
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,969
[Man] Someone broke onto the farm!

463
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,346
Maybe they're rehearsing a one-act play

00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:24,056
called someone broke onto the farm

465
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:25,992
and someone just said the titular line?

- Oh.
- Irving, this isn't safe.

Get in the car, lock the doors.

and argue with me...

To... to... Todd?

Oh, I found her! Diane!
This one's Becca!

No! Todd! Don't you get it?

00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,017
- They're all Becca.
- Oh.

485
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,644
Okay, go, chickens! You're free.

486

Go, run to freedom!

for these creatures, you hear?

I don't know why
I always get into these messes.

500
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,601
You know,
sometimes I feel like my whole life

501
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:54,021
is just a series
of loosely-related wacky misadventures.

502
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:57,983
I think
that's just what being in your 205 is.

503

- Really?
- Yeah.

504
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:02,780
I'm supposed to be the adult here,
and I'm a total mess.

505
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,990
You kidding?
You're the coolest person I know.

506
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,159
- Really?
- Yeah. You always know what to do,

507
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,953
and you don't take shit from anyone.

508
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,579
Is that how you see me?

509
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,541
Of course. You're like Lara croft.

510
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,793
In Diane's body.

511
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,213
[Levi cocks gun,
then Todd whimpering]

512
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:21,465
- This is our chance. Let's go!
- Come on!

513
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:22,632
[Diane] Go, go, go!

514
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:23,716
[All gasping]

515
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,553
Please. Take me with you.

516
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,930
I hate it here.
I don't want to kill chickens.

517
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:31,100
I want to design video games
that help kids learn math.

518
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:34,019
Whoa!

519
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,814
I am so sorry.

520
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,941
Okay, that was crazy! Just go.

521
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:41,110
Let's get out of here!

522
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,576
We're free, we're free! Oh, shit.

523
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:49,869
[Siren whoops]

524
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,120
[Tires screech]

525
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:55,457
Well, well,
looks like birds of a feather

526
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,792
go to jail.

527
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:59,128
- [Clucking]
- Why was he wearing sunglasses

528
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:00,546
at night?

529
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:05,551
I hope you folks like community service.

530
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,720
- I do.
- What? Oh.

531
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,055
Oh, my god, Irving,
thank god you're safe.

532
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,640
Mom, I'm fine.

533
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,018
Stop embarrassing me
in front of my cool friends.

534
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,103
What? Cool?

535
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:19,523
I mean,
that's cool that you think I'm cool.

536
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,276
I don't care or anything,
but, you know, it's cool.

537
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,612
Hey, this guy.
What'd you get arrested for?

538
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,447
- Being too cute?
- [Chuckles]

539
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:27,656
I want to be in his cell.

540
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:28,967
- [Chuckles]
- Listen up, everybody.

541
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:31,994
I, famous celebrity bojack horseman,
have an announcement.

542
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,996
I'm going to ask you to drop all charges

543
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:35,956
on account of me being a celebrity.

544
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,667
We gracefully accept
the requisite slap on the wrist

545
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,836
and a brief,
but ultimately pointless, trial

546
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:43,505
in the court of public opinion.
Good day.

547
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,800
Well, you are famous,
so you are all free to go.

548
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,010
[Stone yells]

549
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:50,262
- But what about Becca?
- Took care of that, too.

550
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,181
Called in a favor with drew Barrymore,

551
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:55,059
and she'll pay off chicken 4 dayz
to adopt your friend.

552
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:58,103
Does she have a Meadow
that Becca can frolic around in?

553
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,898
You think drew Barrymore
doesn't have a frolicking Meadow?

554
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:02,733
That is the dumbest thing I've heard.

555
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,485
I learned something today.

556
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:06,570
When you think
something isn't about you,

557
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:09,490
you find a way to save the day
and realize that it was,

558
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:11,784
all along, all about you.

559
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:12,951
[Groans]

560
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:15,079
Plus, I got you all a burrito truck!

561
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,498
- Hooray!
- Yay! I'm great!

562
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:24,046
So, after all that,
the only thing that saved Becca

563
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,548
was that bojack was friends
with drew Barrymore?

564
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,051
- Yep.
- So, did anything we did matter?

565
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:30,803
- Nope.
- I think it did.

566
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,680
I think we made a difference.

567
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,932
A small one, but a difference.

568
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,267
Yeah, I think we did, too.

569
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:40,813
I think we really changed things
for the better.

570
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,111
