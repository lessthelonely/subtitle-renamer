1
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:13,514
Horsin' around is filmed
before alive studio audience.

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,766
Mondays.

3
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:18,644
Well, good morning to you too.

4
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:19,978
Oh, hey.

5
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,813
Where? I'd love hay.

6
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:28,070
In 1987, the situation comedy
horsin ' around

7
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:29,530
premiered on abc.

8
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,740
The show, in which
a young, bachelor horse

9
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:33,951
is forced to reevaluate
his priorities

10
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:36,370
when he agrees to raise
three human children,

11
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,247
was initially dismissed
by critics

12
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:41,833
as broad and saccharine
and not good,

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,545
but the family comedy struck
a chord with america

14
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,797
and went on to air
for nine seasons.

15
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:49,841
The star of horsin'around,
bojack horseman,

16
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,051
is our guest tonight.

17
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,302
Welcome, bojack.

18
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,845
It is good to be here, Charlie.

19
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,292
Sorry I was late. The traffic...

20
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:56,557
It's really no problem.

21
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:57,951
I parked in a handicapped spot.

22
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:58,975
I hope that's okay.

23
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,059
You parked in a...

24
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,143
I'm sorry, disabled spot.

25
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,647
Is that the proper nomenclature?

26
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:05,274
Maybe you should move the car.

27
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,834
No, I don't think
I should drive right now.

28
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,569
I'm incredibly drunk.

29
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,446
You're telling me
that you're drunk right now?

30
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,448
Is it just me,
or am I nailing this interview?

31
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:14,968
I kind of feel like
I'm nailing it.

32
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,451
Yes.

33
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,246
Anyway, we were talking
about horsin'around,

34
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:21,540
to what do you attribute
the show's wide appeal?

35
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:22,958
Charlie, listen, you know,

36
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,352
I know that it's very hip
these days

37
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:25,877
to shit all over horsin'around,

38
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,364
but at the time,
I can tell you...

39
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,731
- Is it okay to say "shit"?
- Please don't.

40
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:29,955
'Cause I... I think the show's

41
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,508
actually pretty solid
for what it is.

42
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,093
It's not ibsen, sure,

43
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,678
but look, for a lot of people,

44
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:37,222
life is just one long,
hard kick in the urethra,

45
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:39,224
and sometimes when you get home

46
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,244
from along day of
getting kicked in the urethra,

47
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:44,104
you just want to watch a show
about good, likable people

48
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,397
who love each other,

49
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:47,124
where, you know,
no matter what happens,

50
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,775
at the end of 30 minutes,

51
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,444
everything's
gonna turn out okay.

52
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,321
You know, because in real life...

53
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,990
Did I already say the thing
about the urethra?

54
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:56,700
Well, let's talk
about real life.

55
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:58,987
What have you been doing
since the show's cancellation

56
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,245
18 years ago?

57
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:01,692
That's a great question,
Charlie.

58
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,874
I, uh...

59
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,459
Uh, I...

60
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,397
Maury! Maury! Maury! Maury!

61
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,232
In the case
of one-year—old Phoenix,

62
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,693
you are the father.

63
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,153
Morning, sunshine.

64
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,989
Why so gloomy, roomie?

65
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,217
First of all,
we're not roommates.

66
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,617
You are my houseguest.

67
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,869
Well, we don't need
to put labels on things.

68
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,836
You sleep on my couch,
and you don't pay rent.

69
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,998
I've had tapeworms
that were less parasitic.

70
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,226
I don't even remember
why I let you

71
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,519
stay with me in the first place.

72
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,823
Because my parents
kicked me out,

73
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,421
and I had nowhere to go,

74
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,587
and even though you don't want
anyone to know it...

75
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,346
You secretly have a good heart.

76
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:42,753
You told me they didn't approve

77
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,433
of your "alternative lifestyle."

78
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,726
I thought you were, like,

79
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,227
a troubled gay teen
or something.

80
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,913
I didn't realize
by "alternative lifestyle"

81
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,147
that you meant you were lazy.

82
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,315
That's on you
for making assumptions.

83
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,609
Also, if you're looking
for the toaster strudels,

84
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,945
I got really high last night
and ate them all.

85
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,616
Did you say
you've had tapeworms?

86
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:07,289
Thanks for meeting me here.

87
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:08,999
I would have invited you
to my office,

88
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,084
but the electric company
shut off our power.

89
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,251
That's unfortunate.

90
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,712
Just an issue with the bank

91
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,130
and a lack of money in it.

92
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:17,424
Now, as you know,
penguin is very eager

93
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:18,675
to publish your memoirs,

94
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,802
but you keep missing
your deadlines.

95
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,053
I know, and I'm sorry,

96
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,805
but I am making great progress.

97
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:27,517
Bojack horseman:
The bojack horseman story,

98
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,103
written by bojack horseman.

99
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,688
Chapter one.

100
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,691
Chapter one.

101
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:39,738
Chapter...

102
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,824
One.

103
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,951
Look, we really need
a bestseller here at penguin.

104
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,704
Things are not that great
for me, money wise.

105
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,873
Aren't you an editor
at a major publishing house?

106
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,792
Yeah, a publishing house.

107
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,438
When was the last time
you saw a book?

108
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:54,711
I thought I saw someone

109
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,272
reading one in the park
the other day,

110
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,774
but it turned out
it was a takeout menu.

111
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,800
Whenever you're ready.

112
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:05,639
We're living
month to month here.

113
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,526
We're kind of counting
on your autobiography

114
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,837
to save the company,
no pressure.

115
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,435
That's actually
a lot of pressure.

116
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,442
Have you considered working
with a ghostwriter?

117
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,022
Ugh, no, thank you.

118
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,607
Look, just give me
one more week,

119
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,192
and I will give you some pages

120
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,236
that'll knock your ass
back to the south pole.

121
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,695
I'm from Cincinnati.

122
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,447
It... that doesn't matter.

123
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:23,740
I'll call you in a week.

124
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:24,907
Yes, one week.

125
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,076
I'm telling you,

126
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:29,079
this book is a top priority
for me.

127
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,544
Oh, right. Yeesh.

128
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,130
You're wearing that to the prom?

129
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,966
What, you don't think it's cute?

130
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,718
Neigh way, Jose.

131
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,181
"Neigh way, Jose.“

132
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,058
I improvised that line.

133
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:51,393
I mean, it was written,

134
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,311
but I gave it
the old bojack spin.

135
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,772
Hey, how many times
have you watched this episode?

136
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,219
Yeah, but do you get it, though?

137
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,525
Because "nay" means no,

138
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,172
but it's also a thing
that horses say.

139
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,070
It works on every level.

140
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:04,239
- I get it.
- Ah, you don't get it.

141
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,745
J“ three little orphans,
one, two, three I

142
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,331
j“ without a home
or a family tree j“

143
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,668
j“ until this horse said,
"live with me" j“

144
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,713
j“ and now we've got
a new family j“

145
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,382
j“ we were lost,
and now we're found j“

146
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,301
j“ and we're j“

147
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,678
j“ horsin' around j“

148
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,389
Are you drunk?

149
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,016
Todd, I weigh over 1,200 pounds.

150
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,727
It takes a lot of beer
to get me drunk.

151
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:34,894
Yes.

152
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,438
Ah, yeah, I see.

153
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,445
You're just bummed out
because Princess Carolyn

154
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:39,733
dumped you last night.

155
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,570
Bojack, we need to talk.

156
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,097
Hey, check out the rug
on that guy.

157
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,596
Slow and steady,
am I right, ladies?

158
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:48,909
Ha-cha-cha.

159
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,410
Who does he think he's fooling?

160
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:51,870
Turtles don't have hair.

161
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:53,121
Stop embarrassing me.

162
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:54,706
That is Lenny turteltaub.

163
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,673
You know, I am not crazy
about the bread here.

164
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,919
Why do I keep eating it?

165
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,838
Bojack, can you please
just listen for a second?

166
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:05,133
You have my undivided attention.

167
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,594
I think
we should see other people.

168
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,721
Were we not seeing other people?

169
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,100
Bojack, I'm almost there.

170
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,560
Wait. Shh! Shut up.

171
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:18,730
Now, that's a horse
of a different...

172
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:19,897
Cruller?

173
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,650
Oh!

174
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:24,486
God, that's good comedy.

175
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,154
- Bojack!
- What?

176
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,405
Everyone gets a mulligan,

177
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,450
and my mulligan
was Carey mulligan.

178
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,370
I'm kidding, jeez.
It was Emily Mortimer.

179
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,205
What is the problem here?

180
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,292
Are you embarrassed of me
because I'm a has-been?

181
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,095
Because you know
that I'm writing that book

182
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,961
that is gonna make
everybody love me again.

183
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,921
You're not really
writing a book.

184
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,315
Well, I already
spent my advance,

185
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,507
so that's a first step.

186
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,175
Look, this has been
a lot of fun,

187
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:49,070
but I need to start
thinking about my future.

188
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,929
I mean, you don't even
respect me enough

189
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:52,096
to have a baby with me.

190
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,180
Whoa, what?

191
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,641
I never explicitly said that.

192
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,267
You said it with your actions.

193
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,434
What actions?

194
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,480
Oh, look at that baby.

195
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,691
Isn't he the cutest baby
you ever saw?

196
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,192
What? What? What? No, no, what?

197
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,505
Step away
from the stolen vehicle, sir!

198
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,433
No, no, no.
Misunderstanding, officer.

199
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,959
I was running away
from my girlfriend

200
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,294
whom I don't respect enough
to have a baby with.

201
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,714
Hey, aren't you the horse
from horsin'around?

202
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,341
Oh, face it.
You're afraid of commitment.

203
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,968
I'm not afraid of commitment.

204
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,594
I commit to things all the time.

205
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,364
It's the following through
on that commitment

206
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:34,388
that I take issue with.

207
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,825
Hey, stupid, isn't that
your friend over there?

208
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,892
Oh, Mr. Peanutbutter?

209
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,269
God, I hope he doesn't see us.

210
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,521
Is that bojack horseman?

211
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:42,981
Oh, jeez, here we go.

212
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,357
Mr. Peanutbutter

213
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,235
and bojack horseman
in the same room.

214
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,571
What is this,
a crossover episode?

215
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,406
You know,
that gets funnier every time.

216
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:52,991
You're being sarcastic,

217
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,011
but I think it does actually
get funnier every time.

218
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,429
We're actually in the middle
of breaking up right now,

219
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,079
- so if you could just...
- Yeah?

220
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,807
- You're in the middle of it?
- Yeah, that's right.

221
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,709
So would it be awkward
if I joined you right now?

222
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,252
Yes, actually,
it's very awkward.

223
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:05,503
Is that not clear?

224
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,048
Yeah, this is awkward right now?

225
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,299
Yes, please leave.

226
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,884
How are you, Mr. Peanutbutter?

227
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,344
Oh, living the dream, p.C.,
living the dream.

228
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,846
Why are you making conversation?

229
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,490
Oh, let's see,
it's the English word...

230
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,266
It's called being polite,
bojack.

231
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,351
But am I crazy
that this is a bad time?

232
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,687
Always a clydesdale,
never a Clyde, eh, bojack?

233
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,064
What?

234
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,690
You'll get that one later, man.

235
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:27,525
Erica, get out of here
with that face.

236
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:28,892
Would it kill you to be civil?

237
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,487
This is why we're breaking up.

238
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,530
So it's not because
of the thing with the baby?

239
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,365
It's because of a lot of things!

240
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,052
Waiter, could we please
have the check?

241
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,636
- Thank you.
- We haven't even ordered yet.

242
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,330
I have wasted so many dinners
on you, bojack horseman.

243
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,874
I don't know how you can expect
anyone else to love you

244
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,626
when you so clearly
hate yourself.

245
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,337
- Here you go.
- Let me see that.

246
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:50,507
$10 for bread?

247
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,217
I don't want to live
in a society

248
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,927
where the premeal bread
isn't free.

249
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,805
It is free if you order a meal.

250
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,431
Can you take me home, please?

251
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,117
Yeah, but I didn't even
eat that much bread.

252
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,202
What did I have?
I must have had...

253
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,269
You ate nine baskets, sir.

254
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,562
Nine... really?

255
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,981
Great, now I'm gonna feel like
a fat ass all week.

256
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,878
You've seen me naked.
Do you think I'm getting chubby?

257
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:12,505
You want to know the real
reason we're breaking up?

258
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:13,529
What was that? Sorry.

259
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:16,008
Couldn't hear you over the sound
of my calories not metabolizing.

260
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,951
This is so classic you.

261
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,369
You're using this bread thing

262
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,287
to avoid talking
about our relationship.

263
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,248
No, that is definitely
not happening.

264
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,791
I'd like to go home now.

265
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:28,670
You think I'm fat.

266
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,588
So yeah,
technically I was dumped,

267
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,423
but the real headline
of the evening was,

268
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,926
"dumb guy eats bread,
gets fat, the end."

269
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,345
What kind of headline is that?

270
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,556
Wasn't there a pizza here
a second ago?

271
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,850
God damn it! Stop the presses.

272
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,685
You're not fat.

273
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:46,396
Oh, hey, let's throw a party.
That'll cheer you up.

274
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,940
No, it won't.
It'll cheer you up.

275
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,427
I'll stand in the corner
by myself

276
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,068
eating cotton candy until I barf

277
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,070
like I did at your last party.

278
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:57,699
Hey, aren't you the horse
from horsin'around?

279
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,245
That was a good party.

280
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,081
Hey, didn't we get a cotton
candy machine for that party?

281
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,584
Who told you Princess Carolyn
and I broke up?

282
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,335
- She did.
- What?

283
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,962
You never took me home, jerk!

284
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,797
Oh, everything's my fault.

285
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,465
Take me home.

286
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,509
Okay, jeez.

287
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,487
But I'm not looking
for parking in silver lake.

288
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,780
I'll slow the car down
to a crawl,

289
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:20,844
and you can duck and roll.

290
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,976
You know what, you can take
a last look at this face,

291
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,704
because it's the last time
you're gonna see it.

292
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:27,728
Hey-up!

293
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,319
Hello?

294
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,880
I've got Princess Carolyn
for you.

295
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,238
Uh, okay.

296
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,489
Bojack.

297
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,074
Oh, my god, we just broke up.

298
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,743
Yeah, but I'm still your agent.

299
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,369
I pride myself on my ability

300
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,955
to separate my professional life
from my personal life.

301
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,122
Great.

302
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,292
Then, as my agent,
do you think I'm getting fat?

303
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:50,459
No way.

304
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,712
You are in the prime of
your life, never looked better.

305
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,214
What about as my ex-girlfriend?

306
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,066
You look like a pile of crap
ate a second pile of crap

307
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,651
and then crapped out
a third pile of crap.

308
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,094
Wait, wait, so which pile
of crap do I look like?

309
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,061
- The third one.
- What? That's the worst one.

310
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,681
I'm not calling you as your ex.

311
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,600
I'm calling you as your agent.

312
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,567
Remember that book
you're pretending to write?

313
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,729
Well, penguin wants an update
on your progress.

314
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,147
Does Tuesday work for you,

315
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:12,708
or are you gonna be too busy
this week

316
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,332
masturbating to old pictures
of yourself?

317
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,378
I told you, that's not
what was happening that time.

318
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,821
I was masturbating to what
the picture represented.

319
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,115
You walked in
at the worst possible moment!

320
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,784
So, Tuesday, though?

321
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:23,951
Yes, fine!

322
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,372
Whoo!

323
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,957
You don't have anything?

324
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,184
Hey, you got
the electricity back.

325
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,334
Good for you.

326
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:32,781
This company is in dire straits.

327
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:35,979
We made a series
of very bad investments.

328
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,447
Ever hear
of a young adult franchise

329
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,175
called the swamp monsters
of Malibu?

330
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:40,718
Uh, no.

331
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:46,599
Then why did we spend
$20 million on marketing?

332
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,394
It's okay, pinky,
go to your happy place.

333
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:51,872
Look, I know you're a busy guy.

334
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:52,936
Actually, I am a busy guy.

335
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:54,274
I live a very active lifestyle.

336
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,486
Can't I just stay home with you?

337
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,947
I know kindergarten is scary,

338
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,949
but you're a big girl now,

339
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,243
and you have to be brave.

340
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,744
Okay, daddy.

341
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:11,416
Wait, did you just
call me "daddy"?

342
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:14,210
Little Sabrina grew up right
before our eyes, right, Todd?

343
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:15,753
Todd?

344
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,920
Todd!

345
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,131
What?

346
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,049
Did Sabrina grow up
before our eyes?

347
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,301
Yes!

348
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:23,927
We're tired of waiting.

349
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:26,014
We're hiring you a ghostwriter.

350
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,141
Diane "nugent"?

351
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,393
She's great, and she's got
a thing for horses.

352
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,437
Check this out.

353
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,147
Hey, secretariat.

354
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,916
You know, I always wanted
to play secretariat in a movie.

355
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,400
He's kind of my personal hero.

356
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,986
Could never get the project
off the ground, though.

357
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,172
I mean, there was this one time
I came close in the '90s,

358
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,876
but then those
prefontaine movies came out,

359
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,868
and people got tired
of seeing running on-screen.

360
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,910
Don't tell me. Tell her!

361
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,412
She's cute.

362
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,664
Call her.
That's a loan, by the way.

363
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,951
We can't afford to be giving out
free books to people,

364
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,543
but you can take
anything you want

365
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,879
from the swamp monsters
swag box.

366
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,386
Oh, god, I'm a failure.

367
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,388
Oh, you're not a failure.

368
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:08,915
Why did I say
I could write a book?

369
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,059
Because you have
an amazing story to tell.

370
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,977
- Relax.
- Relax?

371
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,479
Easy for you to say, you hippie.

372
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,190
You've never had a day of stress
in your life.

373
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,941
Ow. Why?

374
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,779
And that's for trying
to sell e on the cartel's turf.

375
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,698
Oh, where's Gabriela?

376
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,451
She went back
to Mexico City, ese,

377
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,661
to be with her husband.

378
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,956
What? No!

379
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,335
- Gabriela, why?
- Who?

380
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:38,753
We were talking about me.

381
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,546
Can you try to focus
for, like, a second?

382
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,382
Oh, yeah, sorry.
You were saying?

383
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,133
Never should have signed
this book deal.

384
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,361
You know what my problem is?

385
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,469
I can't say no to people

386
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:47,996
because I want everyone
to like me.

387
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,516
You want everyone to like you?

388
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:52,892
Yeah, why?

389
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,268
Do people not like me?

390
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,654
What were we talking about?

391
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,447
I can see the headline now,

392
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:10,159
"stupid bojack writes a stupid
book about his stupid life,

393
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,369
nobody cares."

394
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:13,246
What newspapers are you reading?

395
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,914
Hey, why don't you just let
that lady

396
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,481
write your book
and be done with it?

397
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,304
Better question,
why are you in my kitchen?

398
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,334
I'm making breakfast.

399
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,045
We had sex last night, dummy.

400
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:22,856
Ugh, I really got to start
putting my phone

401
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,382
on airplane mode when I drink.

402
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,487
This lady probably thinks
I'm just some dumb sitcom actor.

403
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,887
I hate her and her stupid,

404
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,597
impossible-to-pronounce
last name,

405
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,141
na-goo-ya-go-goo-goo-goo-ga.

406
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,642
You haven't even met her.

407
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,102
Give her a chance.

408
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,854
Oh, you should invite her
to the party.

409
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,020
What party?

410
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:40,273
Why are you so obsessed

411
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,920
with throwing a party
all of a sudden?

412
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:44,527
Ow, ow, ow!

413
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,494
You know how much money
we lost 'cause of you?

414
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:50,116
I can't even afford a hall now
for my daughter's 15th birthday,

415
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:53,786
and now I got a hundred guests
coming and nowhere to put them.

416
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,915
You owe me a party, cabrén,
and if you don't deliver...

417
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,004
Because parties are fun?

418
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:04,714
This book
is really important to me.

419
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,358
I don't want to just
hand it off to some stranger.

420
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,092
If it's so important,
why have you written

421
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,778
literally nothing
in a year and a half?

422
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,095
It's too much pressure.

423
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:14,056
This book is my one shot
at preserving my legacy.

424
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,184
I'm a joke,
and if this book isn't good,

425
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,894
I'm gonna be a joke forever.

426
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,788
Everyone thinks that I'm just
this washed-up hack,

427
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,397
but actually...

428
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,983
Oh, god, actually,
what if they're right?

429
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,902
I can't breathe.

430
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,069
Am I dying?

431
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,322
Toast I smell burning toast!

432
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,991
Oh, my god, my toast!

433
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,035
Todd, on my grave,

434
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:39,499
I want it to say
that I was born in 1975.

435
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,666
No one's gonna believe...

436
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,835
Damn it, can't you respect
a dying man's wish?

437
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,420
You're not dying.

438
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,887
Well,
we did everything we could.

439
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,805
Nurse, record the time of death.

440
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,807
It doesn't get easier.

441
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,392
It never gets easier.

442
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,731
What... I don't...

443
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:06,984
What do you mean he's dead?

444
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,694
That's right, sweetheart.

445
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,571
He died of a broken heart

446
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,657
because you didn't
appreciate him enough,

447
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,617
and now he's gone forever.

448
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,869
We might have gone too dark
on that series finale.

449
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,196
I'm required to hand you over

450
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,039
to the child protective
services.

451
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,433
You're the state's problem now.

452
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,876
No!

453
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,462
Do you just take those DVDs
with you everywhere you go?

454
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:27,989
Linus walked around
with a blanket.

455
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,340
No one gave him shit for it.

456
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:30,901
How long is that doctor
going to take?

457
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,528
I have a meeting
with another client at 3:00.

458
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:33,552
You have other clients?

459
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:36,013
No, I make a living off you
sitting on your ass all day.

460
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,016
Are your other clients
more talented than I am?

461
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,434
Your silence speaks volumes.

462
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,353
J“ that was my intention j"

463
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,439
well, bojack, it looks like
what you experienced

464
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,483
was a mild anxiety attack.

465
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,026
Jesus, if that's mild,

466
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,445
I don't want to know
what spicy feels like.

467
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:52,738
Too smart for the room?

468
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,073
It was a salsa joke, people.

469
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,575
You've been overstressed.

470
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,577
I need you to take it easy.

471
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,412
Take it easy, are you kidding?

472
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,831
He doesn't have a job.
He has no real responsibilities.

473
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,791
He doesn't do anything
but take it easy.

474
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,836
Well, can you take it
even easier?

475
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,505
I can try, doctor. I can try.

476
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,757
This book deal is
obviously stressing you out.

477
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,843
Will you just call
the ghostwriter already?

478
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:18,097
What, you want me to call
this woman on the phone?

479
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:22,310
Well, you just had
another anxiety attack.

480
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,436
And entertainment weekly
said I wasn't consistent.

481
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,607
Really, not even a pity laugh?

482
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,275
I did almost die.

483
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,112
I have to check
on some other patients.

484
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,530
You have other patients?

485
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,741
Bojack,
let's have a party, okay?

486
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,093
I'll organize the whole thing.

487
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,317
You can invite the ghostwriter

488
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,037
and have a nice,
casual conversation

489
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,998
in a fun,
pressure-free environment.

490
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:46,000
Okay, fine. We'll have a party.

491
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,501
Oh, thank god.

492
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,187
But we're not getting
a cotton candy machine.

493
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,772
I can't control myself
around those things.

494
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,214
I totally hear
what you are saying,

495
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,383
and I will do my best.

496
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:11,651
Sefior horseman, I will never
forget your generosity today.

497
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:15,112
You have made
a powerful ally for life.

498
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,989
Mwah. Let's dance!

499
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,449
Todd, who was that guy?

500
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:19,700
Who are all these people?

501
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,327
Oh, you know,
just a variety of folks

502
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:22,494
from all walks of life.

503
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,913
Is this a quinceafiera?

504
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,831
Oh, so any party
with Mexican teenage girls

505
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:26,998
is a quinceafiera?

506
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,459
Now who's racist?

507
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,590
I find that pinata offensive.

508
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,175
If you'll excuse me,

509
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:39,804
I have a virgin of Guadalupe
pendant to present.

510
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,851
Bojack!

511
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,269
Oh, good lord.

512
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,563
Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

513
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,233
Can you believe this,
the two of us in the same house?

514
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,235
Is this a crossover episode?

515
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:56,612
No, I'm just kidding around,
man.

516
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,906
Seriously, though, how are you?

517
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:00,175
Well, I've been kind of up and...

518
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,867
Living the dream, huh? Yeah.

519
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,786
Hey, we'll catch up later,
all right?

520
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,913
I want to talk to you.

521
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,374
Erica, how are you looking
so beautiful?

522
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,542
I'm furious.

523
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,050
Hey, bojack, right?

524
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,469
- Bojack horseman?
- Yes.

525
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,031
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry, I don't want
to mispronounce your name.

526
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,515
It's Diane.

527
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,100
Oh, Diane.

528
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:27,893
Thanks for inviting me
to your party.

529
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,329
Sorry I haven't really
been mingling.

530
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,439
I get kind of awkward
at parties.

531
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,357
- Have you tried alcohol?
- I don't know.

532
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:37,278
Parties make me anxious
in a real broad sense.

533
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:38,988
Like, look at that guy.

534
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:40,281
He's having fun.

535
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:41,608
Why haven't I figured it out?

536
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:42,699
What guy?

537
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:43,993
No, there's no guy there.

538
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,287
I'm just saying, like,
a guy, you know?

539
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:47,705
Oh, okay, yeah.

540
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:49,623
I'm probably
just overthinking it

541
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,542
because I never got the practice

542
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,562
because I didn't get invited
to any parties in high school.

543
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,296
What am I talking about?

544
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,006
You don't care
about any of that.

545
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,466
Shut up, Diane.

546
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,509
You're at a party,
compliment the host.

547
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:03,012
You have a lovely home.

548
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,055
Yeah, well,
if you're gonna throw away

549
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,099
most of your adult life
on some dumb sitcom,

550
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,586
you might as well get a sweet
house out of the deal, right?

551
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:12,563
So what are you
working on these days?

552
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,874
Well, mostly
I just sit around the house

553
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,191
and complain about things.

554
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,276
Yeah, how's that
working out for you?

555
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:18,903
I can't complain, so you know.

556
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,238
No, I will not
have sex with you!

557
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,908
This girl wants me
to have sex with her.

558
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,743
No, I'm just kidding around.

559
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,328
You're a good sport.

560
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:29,580
- Ugh, you know who that is?
- Mr. Peanutbutter?

561
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:31,916
Yeah, he was on that show
Mr. Peanutbutter's house

562
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,627
about that dog who adopted
the three human kids.

563
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:37,546
What a dumb idea for a TV show.

564
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,965
You people are all right.

565
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,425
Who wants an autograph?

566
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:42,927
He's so stupid
he doesn't realize

567
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,429
how miserable he should be.
I envy that.

568
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:47,916
Hey, do you know the story
of the dad from the Brady bunch?

569
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:49,266
Do I know his story?

570
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,601
If I recall correctly,

571
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:51,828
he was bringing up
three boys of his own.

572
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:52,852
Right, but...

573
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,122
They were four men
living all together,

574
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,147
but they were all alone.

575
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,066
That is profoundly sad.

576
00:21:57,233 --> 00:22:00,194
No, the story is that the guy
who played the dad

577
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:03,489
hated being on the Brady bunch
because he was a real actor,

578
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,241
and he considered it
beneath him.

579
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,659
Sound familiar?

580
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,536
That's not all
that was beneath him.

581
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,830
Gay joke.
Sorry, I'm better than that.

582
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,665
Most people don't even get to do

583
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:14,208
the Brady bunch version

584
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,977
of the thing they want to do
with their lives.

585
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,128
You're actually
in a really good position now,

586
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,215
because you can pretty much
do anything you want.

587
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:22,025
You're responsible for
your own happiness, you know?

588
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,093
- Good lord, that's depressing.
- No, it's not.

589
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,803
I'm responsible
for my own happiness?

590
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,013
I can't even be responsible
for my own breakfast.

591
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,815
Todd!

592
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,066
I need help.

593
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,735
What would make you happy?

594
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,571
Well, finishing my memoir,
I guess.

595
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,614
Is that all?
I can help you with that.

596
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,867
Yeah?
I mean, would you even want to?

597
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,594
You'd have to spend
a lot of time with me.

598
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:50,870
You'd probably get sick of me.

599
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,476
I don't think
that's going to happen.

600
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,415
- No?
- No, bojack.

601
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:56,041
Okay.

602
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,877
Well, then I guess you're hired,

603
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,355
but don't put all that stuff
about how sad I am in the book.

604
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,505
Oh, that doesn't count.

605
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:02,792
We weren't on the clock yet.

606
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,133
Yeah, exactly.

607
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:09,597
You're only my ghostwriter
starting nah...

608
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,265
- Starting now.
- You got it.

609
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:13,267
- Bojack!
- Ugh, this guy.

610
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:15,144
Hey, man,
wanted to let you know,

611
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:16,729
you are out of beer.

612
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,063
Oh, I see you've met

613
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,710
my beautiful girlfriend,
Diane Nguyen.

614
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:21,191
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second.

615
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,443
You drank all my beer?

616
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,486
- Also, you two are dating?
- Yeah.

617
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,280
- You're dating him?
- Yes.

618
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:27,448
This is your boyfriend?

619
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:28,866
- That is correct.
- Uh-huh.

620
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:30,826
- You are going out with you?
- Uh-huh.

621
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:32,593
But in a sexual way,
not just as friends?

622
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:34,097
- That's right.
- You have seen her naked.

623
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,247
Many times, yes.

624
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,774
- You are attracted to this?
- Yes.

625
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:38,500
This penis has been
inside this vagina.

626
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:39,769
- Yep.
- But in a sexual way.

627
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,004
Oh, yes.

628
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:43,171
Humph.

629
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,259
- Ugh.
- Oh, my god.

630
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,055
Are you okay?

631
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,221
I'm just...

632
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:55,017
I'm fine.

633
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:56,727
I'm just...
I'm really happy for you.

634
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,605
Should we get someone, or...

635
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,231
No, everything's...

636
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,150
Oh, this is really...

637
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:04,693
Wonderful.

638
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,861
Oh, god.

639
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,033
Starting now.

640
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:19,708
J“ back in the '90s j”

641
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:24,797

642

643
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,260
j“ bojack the horse j”

644
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:34,223
j“ don't act like you don't know I
