about the bread here.

just listen for a second?

Are you embarrassed of me
because I'm a has-been?

198
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,095
Because you know
that I'm writing that book

199

that is gonna make
everybody love me again.

You're not really
writing a book.

spent my advance,

it's the English word...

about our relationship.

I mean, there was this one time
I came close in the '90s,

You have other patients?

Bojack,
let's have a party, okay?

528
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,093
I'll organize the whole thing.

pressure-free environment.

532
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:46,000
Okay, fine. We'll have a party.

533
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,501
Oh, thank god.

534
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,187
But we're not getting
a cotton candy machine.

535
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,772
I can't control myself
around those things.

536
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,214
I totally hear
what you are saying,

537
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,383
and I will do my best.

Sorry I haven't really
been mingling.

I get kind of awkward
at parties.

- Have you tried alcohol?
- I don't know.

581

in a real broad sense.

No, there's no guy there.

a guy, you know?

Oh, okay, yeah.

589
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:49,623
I'm probably
just overthinking it

590
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,542
because I never got the practice

591
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,562
because I didn't get invited
to any parties in high school.

592
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,296

You don't care
about any of that.

You're at a party,
compliment the host.

You have a lovely home.

597
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,055
Yeah, well,
if you're gonna throw away

598
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,099
most of your adult life
on some dumb sitcom,

599
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,586
you might as well get a sweet
house out of the deal, right?

600
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:12,563
So what are you
working on these days?

601
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,874
Well, mostly
I just sit around the house

602
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,191
and complain about things.

603
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,276
Yeah, how's that
working out for you?

604
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:18,903
I can't complain, so you know.

605
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,238
No, I will not
have sex with you!

606
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,908
This girl wants me
to have sex with her.

607
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,743
No, I'm just kidding around.

608
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,328
You're a good sport.

609
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:29,580
- Ugh, you know who that is?
- Mr. Peanutbutter?

610
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:31,916
Yeah, he was on that show
Mr. Peanutbutter's house

611
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,627
about that dog who adopted
the three human kids.

612
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:37,546
What a dumb idea for a TV show.

613
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,965
You people are all right.

614
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,425
Who wants an autograph?

615
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:42,927
He's so stupid
he doesn't realize

616
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,429
how miserable he should be.
I envy that.

617
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:47,916
Hey, do you know the story
of the dad from the Brady bunch?

618
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:49,266
Do I know his story?

619
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,601
If I recall correctly,

620
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:51,828
he was bringing up
three boys of his own.

621
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:52,852
Right, but...

622
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,122
They were four men
living all together,

623
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,147
but they were all alone.

624
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,066
That is profoundly sad.

625
00:21:57,233 --> 00:22:00,194
No, the story is that the guy
who played the dad

626
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:03,489
hated being on the Brady bunch
because he was a real actor,

627
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,241
and he considered it
beneath him.

628
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,659
Sound familiar?

629
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,536

that was beneath him.

with their lives.

You're actually
in a really good position now,

635
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,215

do anything you want.

your own happiness, you know?

- No, it's not.

for my own happiness?

for my own breakfast.

I guess.

Is that all?
I can help you with that.

645
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,867
Yeah?
I mean, would you even want to?

646
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,594
You'd have to spend
a lot of time with me.

647
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:50,870
