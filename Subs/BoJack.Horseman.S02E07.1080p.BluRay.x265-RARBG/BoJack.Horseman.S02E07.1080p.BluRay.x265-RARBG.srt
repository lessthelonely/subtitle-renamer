[Crowd cheering]

2
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:14,515
Thank you, Billy crystal,
for that impression of a black person.

3
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,809
- I'm Scott wolf.
- And I'm Matthew fox.

4
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:19,728
We may be a group of five on TV,

5
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:21,980
but any of these next nominees
would be welcome

6
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:24,858
to join our party any day.

7
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,568
[Microphone feeding back]
[Man coughs]

8
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:31,490
The nominees for male animal in
a comedy, drama or variety show are:

9
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:34,368
Bojack horseman,
horsin ' around.

10
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:37,579
Now that's what I call
horsin' around.

11
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:38,890
[Audience laughs and applauds]

12
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:39,957
Uh... yeah.

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,502
Mr. Peanutbutter,
Mr. Peanutbutter's house.

14
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,797
Now that's what I call
doggin' around.

15
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:48,257
[Audience laughs and applauds]

16
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:49,591
[Laughs]

17
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,802
And finally, my personal favorite,

18
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:55,514
Hank hippopopalous,
Hank after dark!

19
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:58,725
Oh, boy, get it off, get it off.

20
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,652
[Baby shrieks]
[Audience laughs and applauds]

21
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,396
Hiya!

22
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,439
And the animals' choice is...

23
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:07,192
Hank hippopopalous,
Hank after dark!

24
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:07,985
[Wolf howls]

25
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:08,902
Oh, yeah.

26
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,862
[Camera shutters clicking]

27
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,365
No, no, no, no.
It's because we're on a show

28
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:16,326
called party of five. Get it?

29
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,370
Hey, buddy,
pass me that bottle of vodka?

30
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:21,498
- That's not really how this works.
- It's open bar, don't be a dick.

31
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,792
- Bojack horseman?
- Do I know you?

32
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,836
This is my better half,
Katrina peanutbutter.

33
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:28,755
- Katrina, bojack. Uh...
- I don't watch TV.

34
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,967
Can I get another drink now or
will that quote, unquote "embarrass" you?

35
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:36,763
- Uh, uh, no, I would never be...
- Erica! Throw me a raft. I'm dying.

36
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,724
My friends told me to get
a prenup,

37
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,269
but I was like,
"hey, marriage lasts forever."

38
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:43,937
Listen, I'm doing my own thing here.

39
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,273
Can you believe two guys like us

40
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,860
were even in the same category
as Hank hippopopalous?

41
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,403
[Chuckles] That's uncle hanky.

42
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,364
Listen, peanutbottle,
there is no "guys like us."

43
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,907
I'm bojack horseman.

44
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:58,683
You're just some other guy
I'll probably never talk to again.

45
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:02,289
Hey, boys.
What is this, a crossover episode?

46
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,290
[All laugh]

47
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,001
That is the funniest thing
I have ever heard.

48
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:09,379
Uncle hanky.
Sir, I am your biggest fan.

49
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:12,382
I used to watch Hank hippopopalous's
dance-pop cosmopolis

50
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,800
every day after school.

51
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,845
- Hey, can I get a picture with you?
- Of course, kid.

52
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:21,600
Here, let me advance this. [Grunts]
And we probably got it.

53
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,393
And we'll find out
in four to six weeks.

54
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,645
Yeah, I can't wait.

55
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,897
Okay, I gotta go.
My wife's hand just disappeared

56
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,440
into that busboy's pants.

57
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:31,735
Treasure? Sweetheart? We're in public.

58
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:32,986
Hey, kid, listen.

59
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:34,696
Don't beat yourself up too bad.

60
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,699
I've seen your show. You're really funny.

61
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,452
- Yeah?
- Yeah. But I'm uncle hanky.

62
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:42,037
You can't beat uncle hanky.

63
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:45,248
That's just the way it is.

64
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,503
This suit needs more flasks.

65
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:52,983
- Diane!
- [Passenger] Aah!

66
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:57,404
Will you bring me one of those
big toblerone bars? [Chuckles]

67
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,782
Well, sure. But, you know, I won't
be out there for another month.

68
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:04,536
Yes, I know, but I always forget to
write these things down.

69
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,496
Tell me, how's your little movie?

70
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,708
Actually one of the stars just died.
It's really sad.

71
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,335
Oh, really? One person died? Just one?

72
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,880
Yeah, well, that's a real tragedy.
Meanwhile, Diane,

73
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,467
here in cordovia, I'm stitching
children's arms back on.

74
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,343
Oh, that's backwards, isn't it?

75
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,847
Are you giving me a thumb's up
or a thumb's down? I can't tell.

76
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,099
Well, now the production's
on hiatus

77
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,310
so bojack and I
are going on a book tour

78
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:31,062
to promote the new paperback edition
of one trick pony.

79
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:32,606
Please get here soon, Diane.

80
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:38,445
The people of cordovia need you
and I need that toblerone.

81
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,030
Okay, listen, you big dummy.

82
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,741
You need to be on
your best behavior for this tour.

83
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:45,452
Don't do that bojack thing
where you go off-script

84
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,078
and get a lot of people
mad at you.

85
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,955
What? I don't do that.

86
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,123
You're a movie star now.

87
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:53,710
Any bad press you get
can hurt secretariat.

88
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,797
Now boarding, flight 422 to Juneau.

89
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,757
Please. We're going to Alaska.

90
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:01,760
How am I gonna offend a bunch
of inbred eskimo blubber-munchers?

91
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:04,137
You're right. What was I thinking?

92
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,473
The republic of cordovia's
prince Gustav

93
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,099
visiting Los Angeles this week

94
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,436
while his country
rests on the brink of civil war.

95
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,480
Prince Gustav
is a ruthless despot,

96
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,525
but I 'd still rather share a bed
with him than my ex-wife.

97
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,777
Shannon, I didn't mean that.

98
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,949
[Dance music playing over speakers]

99
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,493
Listen. With hey, I think you
can dance as a lead-in,

100
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,140
we are expecting big things
for hollywoo stars and celebrities:

101
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,623
What do they know? Do they know things?
Let's find out,

102
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:36,628
or h.S.A.C. W.D.T.K.D.T.K.T.L.F.O.
For short.

103
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,564
- Mm.
- [Wanda] Why don't we get Hank in here?

104
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,148
You guys can get
some pictures together.

105
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,050
Hank is coming here?

106
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,344
That old guy from
hey, I think you can dance?

107
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,972
- What's the big deal?
- You don't understand.

108
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:50,100
When I was a kid,
this guy was the guy.

109
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:53,937
I even bought his novelty rap album,
the Hank hippopopalous hip hop hypothesis.

110
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,106
You shouldn't meet your hero
on an empty stomach.

111
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:58,153
- Want me to go get you some chili?
- Good call.

112
00:05:58,275 --> 00:05:59,860
Chili is nature's chillaxative.

113
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,571
Hiya, folks! Howdy!

114
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,657
- Hank hippopopalous.
- Oh, we've met.

115
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:09,077
Oh, oh, yeah. I remember that.

116
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,871
Okay, so, I thought for the ad,

117
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,397
you guys could stand back to back.

118
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,332
And then on the billboard it'll say:

119
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:19,713
"Hank and Mr. Peanutbutter are back
to back. Thursdays on mbn." [Laughs]

120
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,215
So, what should I do with my arms?
Like akimbo?

121
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,675
- You're fine.
- Reverse akimbo?

122
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,886
- No, that...
- King tut? Mashed potato? Windmill?

123
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,929
Uh-oh, I'm windmilling.
Got a momentum going.

124
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,806
- Can't stop windmilling now.
- Hey, hey.

125
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,601
Why don't we just do
what feels natural?

126
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,603
Guys like us? We're pros.

127
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,854
"Guys like us"?

128
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,731
You think I'm a guy like us?

129
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,066
Oh, this is the happiest moment
of my life.

130
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,902
Excuse me,
would you get a picture of us?

131
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,279
Yeah, that's kind of the idea.

132
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,992
Now we open the floor to questions
from the audience.

133
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:53,788
Bojack, your book talked a lot about
how much you love apple fritters.

134
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,332
Yeah, thanks for that, Diane.

135
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,708
So, my question is:

136
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,127
Do you think Israel
has a right to defend herself?

137
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,014
- Uh...
- And what part should the U.S. play

138
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,129
as an ally?

139
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,340
[Groans]

140
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,634
Well, the thing about that...

141
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,636
[Both growl]

142
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:11,097
Uh... it's a shame that arafat
walked away from the table in 2000.

143
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,892
I mean, obviously there's no panacea,
but a two-state solution

144
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,895
with an emphasis on human rights
feels like a place to begin.

145
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:17,854
[Audience murmuring]

146
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,690
[Moose] Brilliant insight.
[Woman] Very good.

147
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,859
- My question is for Diane nyu... nyu...
- Oh.

148
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,945
_ ny“-—
-you won't get it. Ask the question.

149
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,738
Your book went to some revealing places.

150
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:29,616
Were you worried at all that it
would hurt bojack or his career?

151
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:30,909
That's a great question.

152
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,203
I'd also like to know
the answer to that, Diane.

153
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:37,165
Well, I think the truth
is worth pursuing, no matter what.

154
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,626
Bojack's not perfect.
There are other celebrities

155
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,963
who have done much worse things
and it hasn't hurt their careers.

156
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,590
- Like who?
- I don't know, like Mike Tyson

157
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:50,637
or... Sean penn, or Josh brolin,
or Christian slater, Woody Allen,

158
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,306
Hank hippopopalous, bill Murray...

159
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,934
Wait, wait, what about
Hank hippopopalous?

160
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:59,104
Well, all of his former assistants
have made the same allegations.

161
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,710
- I feel like we're getting off track.
- Do you not know that?

162
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,295
Any questions about me,
the handsome, famous horse with a book?

163
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,986
What do you have against uncle hanky?

164
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,072
I'm not saying anything
not on the public record.

165
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,699
You can just Google
"Hank hippopopalous allegations" and I...

166
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,505
Oh, you don't have to
Google it right now.

167
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,243
[All gasp]

168
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,410
Dear god.

169
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,581
Stanky hanky?
Allegations vile and ranky.

170
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,334
But first, the visiting
cordovian prince Gustav

171
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,211
went missing briefly
this afternoon,

172
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,798
but he was quickly found
buying chili in Beverly Hills.

173
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:31,219
His official statement was,
"uh, yeah, I'm the prince of cordovia.

174
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,346
Hooray, being a prince."

175
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,766
Our main story,
ominous and anomalous accusations

176
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,351
against Hank hippopopalous.

177
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:40,353
Who is this anonymous Diane Nguyen

178
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,023
and what does she have against
our beloved hippopotamus?

179
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,066
Joining me now is
hippopopalous apologist

180
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,736
and armchair sociologist,
cardigan Burke. Cardigan,

181
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,112
what are these allegations?

182
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,115
These allegations are so crazy,
I can't even say them on TV

183
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,034
or I'll sound like a crazy person.

184
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,745
What I want to know
is why we're letting a national treasure

185
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,914
face the same kind of smear tactics
used by the viet cong.

186
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,833
Are you calling attention to the fact

187
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,419
that Ms. Nguyen is Vietnamese?

188
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:07,047
I'd like to think that's a coincidence.

189
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,092
Diane, you've got to see
this set they're building!

190
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,886
There's a giant replica of my head,

191
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,680
and every episode, the eyes
light up with dollar signs,

192
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:18,892
confetti shoots out of the ears,
then I somersault out the mouth.

193
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,102
We're bringing class
back to primetime.

194
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,813
- Sounds amazing.
- And I'm really getting along

195
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,065
with jd. Salinger.

196
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,318
- Did you know we both hate phonies?
- I did know that.

197
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,738
So... listen.
Some website called tit puncher

198
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:35,116
is saying you said some stuff
about Hank hippopopalous.

199
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,869
Oh, my god, Mr. Peanutbutter,
I didn't mean for that to happen.

200
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:40,914
Hey, do me a favor.
Please don't make a big thing out of this.

201
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:44,000
It's really not a good time, you know,
with my show about to launch.

202
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:47,253
- Hey, we are on the same page.
- Oh, are you also on tit puncher?

203
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,172
Because you should not read
the comments.

204
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,007
Believe me,
nothing would make me happier

205
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,967
than for this to just go away.

206
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,720
- Great. I love you, too.
- Hello.

207
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:58,014
- Oh, my god!
- Is chili you ask for.

208
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:59,974
I am peasant boy Todd
from village.

209
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:03,728
Friend of peanut man, and lover
of federated American states.

210
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,898
No reason for suspicions.
[Laughs] Come on!

211
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:10,193
Wait a second, something's different.
[Sniffs]

212
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,029
I am... digging this new Cologne!

213
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,948
You smell like a fancy cabbage.

214
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:18,284
Is so great to be
in meager trash city Los Angeles

215
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,079
with no pressures of royal life.

216
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:24,332
What? Royal life?
Why I'm saying? I am no royal.

217
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,000
[Chuckles] Look at me. Normals.

218
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,295
There's that classic
self-deprecating Todd wit.

219
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:30,964
I'd know it anywhere.

220
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:37,720
- We will now begin our q and a.
- Fire when ready.

221
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,890
What you got against uncle hanky,
you uppity cooze?

222
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,697
Diane,
I believe this question is for you.

223
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,686
If anyone here has any questions
about the book,

224
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,062
I'd be happy to answer those.

225
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,349
As would I, bojack horseman,

226
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,858
golden-globe winning
star of the book.

227
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:53,444
If Hank did anything wrong,
they wouldn't let him on TV, right?

228
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,613
I'm really not here
to talk about that.

229
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,407
You women are all the same.

230
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,200
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, you make these

231
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,286
broad accusations
to get attention for yourself,

232
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,747
and when you don't have proof
to back it up, you just slink away.

233
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,207
I'm not slinking away.

234
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,126
I just wanted to say one thing
about me.

235
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:11,337
I text and drive like all the time.
What?

236
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:14,841
Isn't that what happened with all
those assistants? They took his money,

237
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,677
and they don't even care
they could be ruining a man's life.

238
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,180
What? They ruined his life?

239
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,226
- You should probably just drop this.
- Oh, I'm gonna drop it, all right.

240
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,268
They don't even know
how much I'm gonna drop it.

241
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,937
The way you said that
made it sound like you won't drop it.

242
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,857
How dare you spread
a narrative that...

243
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,184
Don't tell me what to spread.

244
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:35,320
I'll spread whatever I want.
It's called one of the amendments.

245
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,655
Ladies, please! Don't get hysterical!

246
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,324
- This is completely...
- Yeah, hi.

247
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,034
I'm Diane's friend, bojack.

248
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:44,037
I came with her. I gotta say
I'm opposed to child labor,

249
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,706
like as a rule, but there
are some kinds of labor

250
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,193
that children are just better at.

251
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,876
You ever try to fit
into a mine shaft?

252
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,879
That is a tight squeeze. What?

253
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,286
Oh, man, probably gonna get
some letters about that, huh?

254
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,883
I'm so incorrigible.

255
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,344
Everyone's paying attention
to me now!

256
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,179
Okay, I'm gonna go get a snack.

257
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,389
Anyone else want a snack?

258
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:07,060
No? That's a no?
On the snacks? Okay.

259
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,479
What do you have against
Hank hippopopalous?

260
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,731
Everyone says
he's a really nice guy.

261
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:12,398
Good point.

262
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,817
That's exactly the problem.
Because he's so nice,

263
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,153
people don't wanna think
he's capable of awful things

264
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,480
so they let him off the hook.

265
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,699
We don't know what happened.
It's a classic "he said, she said."

266
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:25,245
"He said, they said."
It's eight different women.

267
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,623
- Are they all lying?
- I mean, probably. We do that.

268
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,959
At this point,
we just don't know enough to judge.

269
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,419
Who are these women?
Have they ever shoplifted perhaps?

270
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,629
Do they wear short shorts?

271
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,131
Do they drink alcohol?
All these things are possible.

272
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,716
We don't know the facts.

273
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,343
See, this is part of the problem.

274
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,970
You're supposed to be a journalist.

275
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,305
You won't even tell your audience
what he's accused of.

276
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,099
You're an expert.
Why don't you tell us?

277
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,350
I'm not afraid to say it.

278
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:50,186
Eight different women,
all former assistants,

279
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:53,064
claim that uncle hanky
took them to a...

280
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,399
What is Diane doing?

281
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,485
I know. It's supposed to be my book tour
and she's upstaging me.

282
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,195
Like how it was supposed
to be my book.

283
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,155
Actually, this might be
a thing she does.

284
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,157
She knows that hippopopalous
is the only thing

285
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,034
keeping my network afloat, right?

286
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,203
The same network
that employs her husband.

287
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,663
Why would she do this?

288
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,797
Sometimes she just whips
herself into a frenzy

289
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,751
and she loses all perspective.
Goddamn it, honeydew?!

290
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,689
Jesus, why does cantaloupe think
every time it gets invited to a party,

291
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,464
it can bring along
its dumb friend honeydew?

292
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,466
You don't get a plus-one,
cantaloupe!

293
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,968
You need to talk to her.

294
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:23,927
Huh.

295
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,682
Wanda, I just got back from a set visit
on contemporary family.

296
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:28,850
It's a disaster.

297
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,911
- What?
- The kids have gone through puberty.

298
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,104
They are rubbing themselves
on everything.

299
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:35,898
If it isn't one thing, it's ano...
Just get a hose!

300
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:45,533
Aha! I went to house to pick up mail
for you like real American Johnny.

301
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,577
- Hey, man.
- Whoa!

302
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,455
You know it's a federal crime to go
through someone else's mail?

303
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:56,252
I do not know your customs,
for I am dirt-poor servant child.

304
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,880
Oh, don't worry about it.
Now walk me through that mail.

305
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:02,550
Death threat for wife, death threat
for wife, once more death threat,

306
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:06,220
and here many monies off
for bed bath beyond.

307
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:09,432
Seems like great u.S.A. Dream castle!

308
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,309
Good lord, that's graphic.

309
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,269
How would she even fit
one of those in there?

310
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:16,189
Some sort of funnel. Oh, I see,
there's actually an illustration.

311
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:21,527
Excuse, dog dog peanut man?
This wife, she poke bear, yes?

312
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,654
Yeah, I guess she kind of did.

313
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:27,408
They have a saying where I am from,
which is here.

314
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,410
Bear not like to be poke.

315
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,788
- Bear get angry...
- Right.

316
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,791
And destroy peasant rebel army

317
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:39,712
with fist of fire of which make
many, many nightmares

318
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,756
to children and men!

319
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:45,551
Todd, I can always count on you
to give me the straight dope.

320
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,553
Please don't ever change.

321
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,721
[Inaudible dialogue]

322
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:49,680
[Women gasp]

323
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,850
Okay, just kill the whole feature.
Replace it with... oh, I don't know.

324
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,685
What's Gwyneth doing for purim?

325
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,729
Diane? I want you
to meet Amanda hannity,

326
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,731
editor-in-chief
here at manatee fair.

327
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,900
The pleasure's yours.
Walk with me, squawk with me.

328
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:04,395
That woman can knock a drink back like
a Kennedy at a wake for another Kennedy,

329
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,781
but damn if she doesn't

"god help us all" and left the room.

495
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:46,073
Now I'm not sure
that was the right answer.

496
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,368
So, then I called Wayne to see

497
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,847
if I could write a story for buzzfeed.
Here's the good news:

498
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:52,997
They'll publish anything.

499
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,957
Hey, um...

500
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:56,166
Can I talk to you?

501
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,751
Yeah, of course. What's up?

502
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:03,424
I asked you, really nicely,
not to make a big thing out of this.

503
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:07,720
- Yeah, I know, but someone...
- Had to say something, right?

504
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,389
And that someone had to be you?

505
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,558
Because... why?

506
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,393
I really don't get it.

507
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,022
What is accomplished by you
being the one to take a stand on this?

508
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:20,857
Mr. Peanutbutter...

509
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,819
This game show
is a really big deal for me.

510
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:27,406
And I know that sounds
stupid to you, and small.

511
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:31,118
But I need this to go well,
and I can't... [sighs]

512
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:32,661
Those are death threats.

513
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,705
People want to murder my wife

514
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:36,540
because of what she's
saying on the news

515
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:39,668
about something that
she has nothing to do with.

516
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,421
"You can't. You stupid, ugly can't."

517
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,590
- Yeah, that doesn't say "can't."
- Oh.

518
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:49,470
God, you know, you'd almost
be safer in cordovia.

519
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,513
Yeah, maybe I should go to cordovia.

520
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,360
I'm obviously not making
a difference here.

521
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,643
Actually, maybe you should.

522
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,938
Go feel good about yourself
and do your important work.

523
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:04,068
And maybe some space
might be good for us.

524
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:08,030
You don't really want me to go,
do you?

525
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:11,533
Why does it suddenly matter
what I want?

526
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:21,627
[Man over pa] Flight 57,
cordovian airlines, now boarding.

527
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,713
Hank, I have to ask, did you do it?

528
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,880
No, I did not.

529
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:28,592
Well, that's good enough for me.

530
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:33,430
Coming up, kanye west claims to hate
thin mints. Our panel is outraged.

531
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,058
Hating thin mints?
Is he legally insane?

532
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:38,686
You can bet we'll get into this
further in the next hour.

533
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:41,855
This is the only thing
I care about now.

534
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:44,649
[Man] Hey.

535
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,111
Smile.

536
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,447
[Sighs]

537
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,493
J“ back in the '905 j“

538
00:24:54,660 --> 00:25:00,165

540
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:09,008
j“ bojack the horse

541
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:15,139
j' and I'm trying to hold onto my past j'

542
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:20,019
j“ it's been so long
I don't think I'm gonna last j“

543
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:23,689
j“ I guess I was trying
to make you understand j“

544
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:27,901
j“ that I'm a horse and a man j"

545
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:32,156

00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:34,033
