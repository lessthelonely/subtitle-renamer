1
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:14,681
Come on!

2
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,141
Oh, is it this guy?

3
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:17,434
Never travel without it.

4
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:19,436
Stop holding up the line, idiot!

5
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:21,355
It's not his fault.
He's just doing his job.

6
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:23,023
It's your fault, dummy.

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,067
I'm sorry, sir,
no liquid over three ounces.

8
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:27,194
This is pappy Van winkle,
friend.

9
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,755
Do you know how old
this bourbon is?

10
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,364
If this was a person,

11
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,491
I would've stopped having sex
with it a year ago.

12
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:33,658
I'm sorry, sir.

13
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:34,952
Do you know who I am?

14
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,662
Come on. Ugh!

15
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:38,431
I'm actually a huge celebrity
on my way to New York

16
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:40,624
for an important meeting
with a book publisher,

17
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:45,420
who wants to publish a book
about me because I am famous.

18
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,023
- That's not...
- Fine, you want me to dance?

19
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,047
I'll dance.

20
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,969
Give me ten seconds, Diane.

21
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,470
This guy's being
a total fascist.

22
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:54,637
Diane?

23
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:55,763
Diane?

24
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:56,974
Over here, bojack.

25
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,600
How'd you get through so fast?

26
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,370
I followed the basic
requirements for air travel

27
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,788
that have been in place
for over a decade.

28
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:02,813
Ugh, weird.

29
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,356
Sir, whoever you are, please...

30
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:06,775
Really? You've never heard
of my TV show?

31
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:08,652
You know very well who I am.

32
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,819
And now if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to New York.

33
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:12,406
Ah, no.

34
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:13,824
More? Come on!

35
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:15,534
Oh, you know what?
Could be this.

36
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:17,341
Oh, my god, he's got a gun.

37
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,454
Relax, it's a lighter.

38
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,461
How much lighter fluid
can I take on the plane?

39
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:24,209
And before you answer,
remember, I'm a celebrity.

40
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,503
We're gonna need
a full body cavity search.

41
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:28,857
Thanks for coming
to New York for this.

42
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:31,024
Let's just say, it's better
for everyone's kneecaps

43
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,320
if I stay out of California
for a little bit.

44
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,739
Always nice to get a change
of scenery, am I right?

45
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,906
I think the New York air's
been good for my health.

46
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,785
I mean, I did find a lump,

47
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,745
but hey, who needs
health insurance

48
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:45,499
when you've got bojack horseman
writing a book, huh?

49
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,292
How's it coming along?

50
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:48,669
It's great.

51
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,195
I'm pumping out
heartfelt anecdotes

52
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,922
and witty observations
left and right,

53
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,216
and this one is spinning it all
into gold.

54
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,343
Your telephone is ringing.
I'm ira glass.

55
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,887
Thank you for being a sustaining
member of public radio.

56
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,597
Everyone has a story,

57
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,484
and your phone's story
is that it's ringing.

58
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:03,975
Excuse me. Hello?

59
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,769
Hurry back, superstar.

60
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,270
I don't think
Diane's working out.

61
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,314
What? Why? Is Diane no good?

62
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:10,982
She's too good.

63
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,527
I don't know if Diane is
damaged enough to tell my story.

64
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,612
She's so... functional.

65
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,280
Oh, I'm so sorry, Mr. Horseman,

66
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,865
she's too functional.

67
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,575
Why don't I just
get on the phone

68
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:21,993
and call a less functional...

69
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,912
What are you talking about?

70
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,914
This is a very bad time, bojack!

71
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:27,708
All right.

72
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,811
You need to promise me that
your book will be on the shelves

73
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,962
and making money by October!

74
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:33,630
All right. Jesus.

75
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:34,881
Uh-huh? Uh-huh.

76
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,425
Uh-huh.

77
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,301
Got it. Sorry I took so long.

78
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,845
Who was that? The library?

79
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,305
Thanking you for never
returning a book late?

80
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,224
That was my brother Tommy.
My dad just died.

81
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,809
Oh, my god.

82
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,453
Did we talk about firming up
the release date?

83
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,330
- I was thinking late September.
- I am so sorry.

84
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,022
It's fine, he was old
and also the worst.

85
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,357
Such a terrible tragedy

86
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,568
really puts everything
in perspective.

87
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,855
Where does that leave us
as far as the book of it all?

88
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,071
Not a problem.

89
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,406
I just got to swing by Boston

90
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:00,800
and give my condolences
real quick.

91
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,284
Bojack can come with me.

92
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:03,678
We'll get some work done
while we're there,

93
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:04,929
and then that way the whole trip

94
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,139
won't be a total waste of time.

95
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:07,163
Great.

96
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,407
Call me if you need anything,

97
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,958
but hang up after one ring,

98
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,805
and I'll call you
back from the phone booth

99
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,296
where my wife and I are living.

100
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,840
J“ Todd bless
these scrambled eggs j'

101
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,967
j“ eggs from the fridge j“

102
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,970
j“ sunny side them
and guide them j“

103
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:24,031
Todd, stop singing
your dumb scrambled eggs song.

104
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,307
Who said that?

105
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,076
If you're wondering
who said that,

106
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,935
it's this note
that you're reading.

107
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,542
You're hearing my voice
in your head,

108
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,981
because that's
how reading works.

109
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,399
Oh, yeah.

110
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:35,817
As you might've noticed, Todd,

111
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,424
I've left you home alone
for the day,

112
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:38,921
and frankly, ialready
regret that decision.

113
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,406
Here's what you need to do.
Nothing.

114
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,408
Don't touch my stuff,
and don't make a mess.

115
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:44,935
Pick me up at the airport
tomorrow,

116
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:48,330
and until then,
don't do anything.

117
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,378
Well, seal's broken.
Might as well enjoy myself.

118
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,423
J“ it's all good j“

119
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,841
whee!

120
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,092
J“ it's all good j“

121
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,679
cheers to bath time.

122
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:08,600
Great story, Todd.
I love our friendship.

123
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,395
Here we go!

124
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,439
The great toddini!

125
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,024
And here we have the home

126
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,276
of a truly dynamic
and unique talent,

127
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,488
TV's own David boreanaz.

128
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,198
All: Ohh!

129
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,825
Sounds like we have some fans

130
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,160
of person of interest on board,

131
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,288
or castle,
or whatever his show is.

132
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,749
Sorry, dudes,
you got the wrong house.

133
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,292
All: Aww.

134
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,670
Crikey, I would've paid $50 U.S.

135
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,130
To see where
David boreanaz lives.

136
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,091
He's the American Hugh Jackman.

137
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:42,300
Oh, yeah, 50 bucks?

138
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,718
Is he the guy in burn notice?

139
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,554
What? 50 bucks?

140
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,347
In that case, come on in,
friends.

141
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,432
Some guy named David boreanaz
lives here.

142
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,394
All: Hooray!

143
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:53,979
Hey, so listen,

144
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,082
I really want to be here for you
in your time of need,

145
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,792
but I'm not really good
with funerals or death

146
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,276
or families or feelings
or people.

147
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,111
Don't worry.
You can wait in the car.

148
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,922
It's probably better
you don't meet my brothers.

149
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:05,073
They're narrow-minded,
mean-spirited dirtbags.

150
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,992
I wish I had
brothers growing up.

151
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:10,579
Touch football on the weekends,
noogie parades on the reg.

152
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:13,498
Life as an only child
can get pretty lonely.

153
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:16,585
Daddy, do you want to meet
my imaginary friend?

154
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,712
Imaginary friends
are free-loaders

155
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,131
invented by communists
to rip-off welfare.

156
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:22,650
Why don't you do
something productive,

157
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:23,985
like bang your head
against the wall

158
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,468
until your brain
isn't so stupid?

159
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,012
Okay, daddy.

160
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,347
Yeah, well, I
was pretty lonely too.

161
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:30,807
My family made
my life miserable,

162
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,451
and then they never
forgave me for leaving.

163
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,977
So, what,
you're like the black sheep?

164
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,770
No, Gary's the black sheep.
He's adopted.

165
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,748
I'm just the member of
the family nobody likes.

166
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,482
And my dad
was the worst of them all.

167
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,151
You told me
that you and your father

168
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,379
used to sit on the roof
and look at the stars together.

169
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,906
Oh, yeah, I was just trying
to get you to open up,

170
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,909
so I used an old writer's trick
called "me lying to you."

171
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,077
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm using an old me trick

172
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,621
called "that hurts my feelings."

173
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,227
And the truth is,
I used to sit alone

174
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,665
on the hill out by the dump

175
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,918
and dream of waking up
as Chelsea Clinton,

176
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,169
but with my hair.

177
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,378
You do have great hair.

178
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,088
I know.

179
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,051
That's us.

180
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,528
I'll just pop in
for a quick hi and bye.

181
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:08,552
Then we'll be on our way.

182
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,263
Ten minutes, swear to god.

183
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,616
You can play
with this kaleidoscope

184
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,724
I got you at the airport.

185
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,726
What? A kaleidoscope?

186
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,519
I'm not five...

187
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,980
Shapes and colors the likes
of which I've never seen.

188
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,857
Hello.

189
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,693
Hey, yeah, deedee came home!

190
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,570
Gary, Marty, Artie,
deedee's back!

191
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:26,737
Come here!

192
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,406
Game. Watching the game.

193
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:29,926
Can't look up from the game.
How you doing?

194
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,159
Marty, it's a game from '86.

195
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,869
You've seen it a hundred times.

196
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,847
And how many times does
Buckner break your heart?

197
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,247
Both: 100 times.

198
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,166
Aw, thank god
you're here, deedee.

199
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,709
Pops is wicked departed.

200
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,711
Oh, yeah, man.
He departed so hard.

201
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,922
And I do not like
them apples, deedee.

202
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,256
Yo, deedee, get me a beer.

203
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,549
Yeah, make that two, deedee.

204
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,677
Gary, Marty, I just got home.

205
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:53,348
Ooh, Princess Diane doesn't
want to get her brother a beer.

206
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,850
Hey, ma, come look
what the pats dragged in.

207
00:07:56,017 --> 00:08:00,647
Oh, hello!
Look who decided to come home.

208
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,525
Queen deedee blesses us
with her presence.

209
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,527
To what do I owe the honor?

210
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:07,414
Look, I'm just here
to offer my condolences.

211
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,408
Oh, sure, in and out,
like a protestant on Christmas.

212
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,934
Why would you want
to stick around,

213
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,428
be with your family
in their time of need?

214
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,829
Come on, ma.

215
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,223
Don't fight while the game's on.

216
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:18,289
It's bad juju.

217
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,125
It's the '86 world series.

218
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,291
Theylose.

219
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:22,711
Ah, why'd you have to...

220
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,838
Oh, we're just a bunch
of savages, right?

221
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,340
We're not like your fancy
California friends.

222
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,927
Your George Clooney
and your California raisins.

223
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,304
Oh, come off it, ma.
She don't mean no harm.

224
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,598
For five years
she didn't come home.

225
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,351
Why don't you make like a-rod
and blow.

226
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,021
Well, this was clearly
a huge mistake.

227
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,397
Ah, don't go.

228
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:43,940
Deedee, please.

229
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,608
Why not?
Ma doesn't want me here.

230
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,569
Ma don't know what she wants.

231
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,320
She wants you here. We all do.

232
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,488
Ain't that right, Marty?

233
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:51,775
Can't look up from the game.

234
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:52,991
Besides, we need your help

235
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,534
organizing all
the funeral stuff.

236
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:55,701
We didn't go to college.

237
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,120
We're not smart like you.

238
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,371
Fine, I'll help.

239
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,831
Is there a number
for me to call?

240
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,500
Yeah, try 1-800-the-Internet,
dummy.

241
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,294
Jeez, do some legwork, Dee.

242
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,755
And do it quick.
The ice is melting.

243
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,757
Oh, my god. Is that dad?

244
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,634
Did someone draw balls
on his forehead?

245
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,428
That was before
we knew he was dead.

246
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,388
We just thought
he was wicked hung over.

247
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,766
In your face, dad!

248
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,477
In your face forever.

249
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:24,939
Welcome to the home
of David boreanaz,

250
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,775
famous from television shows

251
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:31,071
such as dramas on networks.

252
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,906
That will be $50 please.

253
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:36,367
Oy, mate, this picture
of David boreanaz fell apart.

254
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,911
Oh, no, no, no,
I'll handle that.

255
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,496
Why don't you just
go look through

256
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,456
David boreanaz's
underwear drawer, okay?

257
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:42,749
It's in his bedroom.

258
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,209
Oh, knickers.

259
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,877
Hey, what do you think
you're doing?

260
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,837
Uh-oh, am I reading
something again?

261
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,465
No, this is your conscience.

262
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:53,051
Bojack trusted you
to take care of his house.

263
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,345
Is this really...
What are you doing?

264
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,285
J“ dun-dun-dun-dun j“

265
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,602
j“ dun-dun-dun j“

266
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,354
it's a great day
on Todd's phone.

267
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,189
How can I help you?

268
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,042
Are you trying to cut me out
of this David boreanaz deal?

269
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,442
I'm your agent, damn it.

270
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,319
How'd you find out
about boreanaz house?

271
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,196
Don't worry,
I'm not just gonna sit here

272
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,424
batting a ball of yarn around
while you do the real work.

273
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,326
I want to take your project
to the next level.

274
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,120
We need to go bigger.

275
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,515
Have you thought about attaching
Mila kunis to this thing?

276
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,415
Attach her? How?

277
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,543
You do your job. I'll do mine.

278
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,670
Who is this?

279
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,507
Ah, out of combinations.
Now I'm bored.

280
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:34,926
Diane!

281
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:38,489
- You show me nothing...
- What do you want from me?

282
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,491
You have no right to barge
in here after five years

283
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,350
and judge us, Diane.

284
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,102
I'm just saying Marty
could lend a hand

285
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,247
instead of sitting on the couch
watching the game all day.

286
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,647
Ah, deedee.

287
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,024
You know very well
his leg's still sore

288
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,776
from the accident at the quarry.

289
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,194
Yeah, he's got to rest up

290
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,946
if he's gonna be
a wide receiver for bc.

291
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,781
He didn't get into b.C.

292
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:58,926
Ah, what's the point of
getting off the couch anyway?

293
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,952
All the jobs are going
to immigrants these days.

294
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,954
What do you... we're immigrants.

295
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,956
- How do you figure?
- We're Vietnamese?

296
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,417
Step off!
We're American as fuck.

297
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,061
And that's the same crap
you always pull...

298
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,405
What do you want from me?
Come on!

299
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,298
Excuse me.

300
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,883
Yes, hello,
I'm looking for Diane.

301
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,551
Does anyone here speak English?

302
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:19,053
Pull over and park the car.

303
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,931
Is that the frickin' horse
from horsin'around?

304
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,767
Again, does anyone here
speak English?

305
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:25,977
- Oh, no way...
- What?

306
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,521
A TV star!

307
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,066
Boreanaz house.

308
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,444
75 each.
Children and seniors free.

309
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:35,987
Please stay behind the ropes

310
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:37,798
and keep your hands and
belongings on your person

311
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,532
at all times.

312
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,327
Next we'll head to the kitchen
where... is that Mila kunis?

313
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,953
All: Ooh!

314
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,789
Note the letters b.H.
On all hand towels and linens.

315
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,875
That stands for
"boreanaz house."

316
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,298
Yeah, do you pick up bodies?

317
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,383
Is that a service you provide?
Corpse removal?

318
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,762
Hey, bojack, you ever meet
any Boston celebrities?

319
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,639
Well, one time at Bristol farms,

320
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,725
Ben Affleck and I did reach
for the same bunch of grapes.

321
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,977
Oh, he eats grapes just like us?

322
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,396
Hey, ma,
Ben Affleck eats grapes.

323
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,065
He don't eat grapes!

324
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,776
Bojack said
he fed Affleck grapes.

325
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,111
He was graping it up
with the daredevil himself.

326
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,530
This is the greatest day
of my life.

327
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,324
Oh!

328
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,510
Hey, I don't suppose you boys
would have any interest

329
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,328
in maybe playing some
touch football later?

330
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:26,704
Are you kidding?

331
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,265
Touch football
with a star like you?

332
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,166
That would be mad wicked pisser.

333
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,773
Ooh, you know what else
we got to do?

334
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,671
We got to watch
the cryane video.

335
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,297
Ooh, that sounds good.
What's that?

336
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,799
No, we don't need
to revisit that.

337
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:39,425
When deedee was 16,

338
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,178
we made up a secret pen pa!
For her named Leo.

339
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:45,556
Guys, I really would rather
not discuss it.

340
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,475
We all took turns
writing her letters,

341
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:50,728
pretending to be this sensitive
boy from Cambridge.

342
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,480
It was wicked messed up.

343
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:55,858
“Oh, Diane, we're
two misunderstood souls.

344
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,694
"Everyone else is a phony.

345
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,238
Yours forever, Leo."

346
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,782
What? That is amazing.

347
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,325
After six months of letters,

348
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,828
we hired a homeless guy
to pretend to be Leo

349
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:09,372
and take her
to the homecoming dance.

350
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:10,933
- Look at her.
- Watch, watch this part.

351
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,709
I like your boutonniere.

352
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,380
Why don't we watch this
every day?

353
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:18,899
- Look at her face.
- Now that's a good prank.

354
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,133
I was humiliated.

355
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,592
Yeah, you wouldn't get it.

356
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,428
It's a brothers thing,
right, brothers?

357
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,305
Whoo! That's cryane for you.

358
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,848
What a pussy.

359
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,433
You know,
it's nice that years later

360
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,101
we can all laugh about this.

361
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:32,020
Yep, my therapist
thinks the same thing.

362
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,980
I'm gonna go meet
with the funeral director.

363
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,648
Any of you boys want to come?

364
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,575
Nah, I ain't so big
on funeral homes, deedee.

365
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,336
All them dead bodies,
they give me the jeebies.

366
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,738
Yeah, deedee,
why do we got to go?

367
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,656
Fine, none of you have to go.

368
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,241
I'll take care of everything.

369
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,208
Thank you, Diane.
We all really appreciate it.

370
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,411
Come on, bojack.

371
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:49,978
Why you got to take
bojack with you?

372
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,205
Boo!

373
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,373
Boo!

374
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,740
Boys, you have stolen my heart

375
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,460
like Dave Roberts
stole second base.

376
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,670
Hey! He knows our things!

377
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,214
I must go now, but I'll see
you all at the funeral, okay?

378
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,759
And when I do,
you're all getting noogies.

379
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:03,925
- Funeral!
- Yeah!

380
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,010
Whoo-hoo!

381
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,137
Funeral!

382
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:07,430
Funeral! Funeral!

383
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,975
And now, a very special treat

384
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:13,227
justfor our platinum members.

385
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,438
Let's take a peak
at the slumbering

386
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:19,233
Mr. Boreanaz himself.

387
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,235
Get out of my room, Todd!

388
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,904
I'm David boreanaz.

389
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,530
Ohh!

390
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,074
And thus concludes our tour.

391
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,909
Have a boreanderful day.

392
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,246
Tell me about your father.

393
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,291
Well, he was a mean,
sadistic alcoholic,

394
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,210
who never supported
anything I did

395
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,212
and actively delighted
in seeing me fail.

396
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,172
Hmm, I see.

397
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:44,842
Sounds like you're looking for
our piece of shit dad package.

398
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,761
That would be too good
for my father.

399
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,513
Hmm, I see.

400
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,808
Might I then suggest
our piece of shit dad package

401
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,143
would be too good
for him package.

402
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,770
Yeah, that's the one.

403
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,980
Excellent choice.

404
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,024
Hey, can I suggest something?

405
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:02,276
You might want to loosen up
a little.

406
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,254
I think you could actually
learn a thing or two

407
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,278
from your brothers.

408
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:06,906
Are you kidding?

409
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,176
If I was like my brothers,
nothing would ever get done.

410
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,618
I'm just saying,

411
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,829
if you can't find a way
to let off some steam

412
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,039
you're going to explode.

413
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,874
God damn it!
Are you god damn kidding me?

414
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,602
I keep getting calls
from this unlisted number.

415
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,378
Ignore. Who are these assholes?

416
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,231
Why don't you just answer,
and then you'll know?

417
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,815
Oh they'd just love that,
wouldn't they?

418
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,842
Ugh, how are we supposed
to blackmail him

419
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,260
if we can't reach him?

420
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,720
Maybe we got to get him
where he lives?

421
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:30,888
You mean?

422
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:34,142
That's right, his house.

423
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,019
What the... whose house is this?

424
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,188
Is that David boreanaz?

425
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:42,108
I could've sworn
bojack horseman lived here.

426
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,835
Hey, let's keep
these lines moving, huh?

427
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,319
You want to stop and chat,

428
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,166
you gotta pay for
the extended stay ticket.

429
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,157
Ah, so much, so much, so much.

430
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:52,243
Another five gs, t-bag,
and we are in the pink.

431
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,744
I don't know, Princess Carolyn.

432
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,788
I ran out of shoeboxes
for the money,

433
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,415
and the books aren't adding up.

434
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:59,584
Plus the men's lav
needs to be serviced,

435
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,586
and I had to fire Janine
in the gift shop

436
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,463
for stealing boreabble heads.

437
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,257
I mean, how did I end up
with all this responsibility?

438
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,468
Hey, I'm not screwing around
here, small fry.

439
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,636
You better make
those numbers sing.

440
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,055
I don't think these
offshore banks we've been using

441
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,724
are 100% legal.

442
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:17,185
Yeah, well, my mother told me
never to slap an idiot.

443
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,561
What? Ow!

444
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,563
Now we're both
breaking the rules.

445
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,648
You listen, and you listen good.

446
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,358
I've gotten used
to a certain lifestyle

447
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,068
since boreanaz house
went public,

448
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,737
and I'm not going back
to the old way.

449
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,489
Mommy likes her shoes, see?

450
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,655
And her pearls.

451
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,575
Oh, I'm in too deep.

452
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:33,951
I don't know what to do.

453
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,637
I'll tell you
what you should do.

454
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,662
Who said that?

455
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,206
It's me, David boreanaz.

456
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,541
Is that what
David boreanaz sounds like?

457
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,959
Uh, sure.

458
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,669
Let me give you some advice.

459
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,881
As we say on my show...
I want to say, new girl?

460
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:49,300
Just keep doing what you're
doing, and you'll be fine.

461
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,469
Wow, thanks, davie b.

462
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:54,430
Never call me that.

463
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,850
Unbelievable.

464
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,894
It's 4:00.
I don't think anyone's coming.

465
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:02,647
Unbe-goddamn-iievable.

466
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,024
All those jerk wads
had to do was show up,

467
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,151
and they couldn't even do that.

468
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:08,611
Where's the body even?

469
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,947
Beg your pardon, minor hiccup.

470
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:15,243
My goons went to pick your
father up, but nobody was home.

471
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,702
For a nominal fee,

472
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,454
we can scrounge up
another body for you.

473
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:22,583
Would you care to peruse
our loaner closet?

474
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,463
Hey, assholes! Where were you?

475
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,840
I planned the whole funeral,
like you asked me to,

476
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,425
and nobody showed.

477
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,232
Yeah, we realized dad
wouldn't have wanted

478
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:34,971
some stuffy funeral.

479
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,257
He would've wanted his body
to be chopped up into chum

480
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,600
and thrown
in Derek jeter's fat face.

481
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,935
Yeah, suck it, jeter!

482
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,687
Wait, what? Where is dad?

483
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,438
We got him chummed.
He's in the truck.

484
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,234
You chummed dad?

485
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,778
It's what your father wanted,
honey,

486
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:53,739
but then you wouldn't know
anything about that, would you?

487
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,116
Let me get this straight.

488
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:56,643
So instead of coming
to the funeral

489
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,662
that I paid for
and spent all day organizing,

490
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,790
you had dad's body
ground into chum,

491
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:06,210
so you could throw his mushy
remains on Derek jeter?

492
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:08,421
No, not just on Derek jeter.

493
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,548
We're gonna throw it
into his fat face.

494
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:12,192
- Yeah, his fat face.
- In his fat face.

495
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,536
The Yankees are in town
this week.

496
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,914
The planets are aligning,
deedee.

497
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,471
Tommy, you begged me
to stay and help.

498
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,933
Why does everything always
got to be about big-shot Diane?

499
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,227
Too good for her home.

500
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,396
I don't think
I'm too good for my home.

501
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,398
Yeah, guys,
you got it all wrong.

502
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:30,818
Diane isn't a big-shot.
She's my ghostwriter.

503
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:34,447
She's writing a book that's not
even gonna have her name on it.

504
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:35,948
You think this
is how she expected

505
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,825
her life would be going at 34?

506
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:40,995
She lives with her rich
boyfriend and doesn't pay rent.

507
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:44,582
She's not too good for anything.

508
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:45,958
What?

509
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,251
Diane's a freeloader?

510
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,544
Even I pay rent.

511
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,465
Bojack helping?

512
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,971
Whoa.

513
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:03,726
This is why I told you
to wait in the car!

514
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,144
Oh, she snapped.

515
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,354
Here comes cryane.

516
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,065
Hey, hey, deedee, come on.

517
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:13,110
Diane, you are making
a public spectacle of yourself.

518
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,655
Deedee, what are you doing
with dad's keys?

519
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,156
Put those back.

520
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,658
Oh, come on, that's dad's truck.

521
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,218
Dad's chum is in the back.

522
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,661
No! No, no, no!

523
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,121
Suck a dick, dumb shits!

524
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,791
Well, that crazy clam did it.
She took pops.

525
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:30,503
Oh, no, what are we gonna do?

526
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,338
And it's a one-hopper
back to the pitcher.

527
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,756
Easy out at first.

528
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:36,092
So what we're gonna do
is nothing?

529
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,219
Sox are on,
and I haven't seen this one.

530
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,221
Does anyone know
where she might have gone?

531
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:42,188
Ah, she used to run off
like this all the time

532
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,264
in high school too.

533
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,476
Who knows where crazy goes.

534
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,770
I think I know where she went.

535
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,271
Wait, you can't leave.

536
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,065
The party's
just getting started.

537
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,484
I don't know,
Diane was pretty upset,

538
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:55,778
and she's got your dad.

539
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:57,363
Oh, don't go, bojack.

540
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,091
You're like the fifth brother
I never had.

541
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,116
I... really?

542
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,659
Yeah, don't leave, bro.

543
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,452
After this,
we'll go play touch football

544
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,787
and do a noogie parade.

545
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:07,248
Ah, um...

546
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:09,542
Everyone please disperse.

547
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,419
This is an unlawful gathering.

548
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:15,297
Disperse immediately.

549
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,234
Oh, this isn't looking good,
Princess Carolyn.

550
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:18,551
What are we gonna do?

551
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:19,969
What do you mean, we?

552
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,596
Princess Carolyn
always lands on her feet.

553
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,474
Mr. Boreanaz, I presume.

554
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:29,019
Um, would you
like a boreabble head?

555
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,563
The amazing thing is,

556
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,773
the house looks
just like bojack's house.

557
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,650
They must have
the same architect.

558
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,277
Anyway, how are things with you?

559
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:37,820
Not good.

560
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,464
I should've known
it was a waste of time

561
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,488
to come back here.

562
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:41,699
Oh, that's awful.

563
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:43,409
Well, when you get back,

564
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,554
I'll give you one of
my patented peanutbutter hugs.

565
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,329
Crunchy and creamy.

566
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,956
You know
that patent wasn't approved,

567
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:51,000
but I'll take it.

568
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,960
I have to go. Bojack's here.

569
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:55,129
Bojack, well, what's he doing?

570
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:58,758
Hey, sorry I said
all that stuff about you.

571
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,968
It's all true, isn't it?

572
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:02,636
I found this letter
back at the bar.

573
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,972
I think it's for you.

574
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,559
Look, just read it.
I think you'll like it.

575
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:13,355
"Dear Diane, it's me,
your old pen pal Leo.

576
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,525
This definitely isn't
bojack horseman writing this."

577
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:17,818
Keep reading.

578
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,820
"You're a good person, Diane,

579
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,114
"and that's
the most important thing.

580
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,908
"Even if no one appreciates you,

581
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,577
"it's important that
you don't stop being good.

582
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,384
"I like how you always
bring your own bags

583
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:29,955
"to the grocery store,

584
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,666
"and how you're always
organized to go places.

585
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:36,712
"I like how you chew gum on the
airplane so your ears will pop.

586
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:39,715
"A lot of people might not
appreciate that about you,

587
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,050
"but I do.

588
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,385
Yours forever, Leo."

589
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,971
That's the best letter
he ever wrote me.

590
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,058
Look, take it from someone
with his own shitty parents,

591
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,935
family is a sinkhole,

592
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,221
and you were right to get out
when you had the chance.

593
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,688
The stupid thing is,

594
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,666
even now I still just want them
to be proud of me

595
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,025
and think I did good.

596
00:21:58,192 --> 00:21:59,902
Is that really stupid?

597
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:01,195
- Yep.
- No, it isn't.

598
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:02,655
Yeah, it is.

599
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,490
You want those guys
to be proud of you?

600
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,897
I guess I was just hoping to
get some modicum of closure.

601
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,285
Closure is a made up thing

602
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,579
by Steven Spielberg
to sell movie tickets.

603
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,873
It's, like true love
and the Munich Olympics,

604
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,750
doesn't exist in the real world.

605
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:18,379
The only thing to do now
is just to keep living forward.

606
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:20,923
Yeah, but every time
I come back here they...

607
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,258
So don't come back here.

608
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,260
What's great about Los Angeles

609
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,887
is nobody cares about where
you're from or who you are.

610
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,305
It's a superficial town

611
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,912
where you can worry
about stupid shit

612
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,433
like keeping your pool clean,

613
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,360
and what artisanal nuts
to put on your salad.

614
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:34,562
I do like salad.

615
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,146
Oh, it's the best.

616
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,624
Why do you think people keep
moving there?

617
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:39,608
Thanks, bojack.

618
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:43,904
The good news is, your dad
can't hurt anyone ever again.

619
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:47,449
Uh-oh.

620
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,036
J“ gonna spend the day I

621
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:55,541
j“ over at Fenway j'

622
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,294
thank you so much, Derek jeter.

623
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,754
I thought a big baseball
hotshot like you

624
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:04,717
would be too busy to help us
old ladies across the street.

625
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:07,386
I always have time
to look out for my elders,

626
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,430
yankee fan or no.

627
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:11,307
Is that a barrel of chum?

628
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,185
J“ only at Fenway j'

629
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,646
j“ ba-dum, ba-da-dum j“

630
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,065
um, I'll meet you inside.
I have to make a call.

631
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,192
Okay.

632
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:28,324
It's herb. You know what to do.

633
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,493
Hey, herb, look,

634
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,330
I think we have some
unfinished business.

635
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,916
It seems like life's too short
to hold grudges

636
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,293
and stuff like that,
you know what I'm saying?

637
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,753
About life being too short?

638
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,147
Well, of course
you know what I'm saying.

639
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:43,631
You're the one with terminal...

640
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,477
I feel like I'm doing
all the talking here.

641
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,343
So anyway, I thought
maybe we could chat.

642
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,428
Why don't you give me
a call, okay?

643
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:53,182
Um... so smell you later?

644
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:55,142
This is bojack. Horseman.

645
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:56,560
Obviously.

646
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:00,981
Ugh, who keeps calling me?

647
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:04,568
Come on, bojack.
Pick up, pick up.

648
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,070
I'm sure he'll pick up.

649
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:08,864
It's bojack.
You know what to do.

650
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,243
J“ back in the '903 j”

651
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:18,082
j“ I was in a very famous TV show j“

652
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,753

653
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,171
j“ bojack the horse j”

654
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:27,341
j“ don't act like you don't know I

655
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,973

656
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,516

657
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:38,894
j“ I don't think I'm gonna last j“

658
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:40,562
j“ I guess I'll just try j”

659
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,481
j“ and make you understand I

00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:47,027

j“ or I'm more man than a horse j“

662
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:53,158
j“ bojack j“

663
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:57,204
boxer versus raptor.
