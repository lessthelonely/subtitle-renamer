[music stops abruptly]

6
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:26,276
Sarah Lynn is very tired.

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,446
Can you just tell her BoJack's here?
Horseman. I'm an old friend.

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,782
Well, I'll tell her, but...

9
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,617
[groaning]

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,079
[Sarah Lynn]
BoJack? Oh, my God! Bring him in!

11
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:40,207
-I can't believe you came to my concert.
-It was incredible.

12
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,085
When you sang that one ballad
and shot fireworks out of your boobs,

13
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,671
that was such a moving tribute
to gays in the military.

14
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,130
We are going out.

15
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,466
Before you go, I need you
to sign these posters.

16
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,052
It's for charity.
Doctors Without Posters.

17
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,054
Okay. BoJack, can you
hang out for a minute?

18
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,932
-Yeah. I'm not going anywhere.
-Also, we have those radio records,

19
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,059
and you're doing the print ads
for Sarah Lynn's Stank,

20
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,561
the new fragrance from Kevin Kline.

21
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,938
-You mean Calvin Klein.
-Kevin Kline, BoJack.

22
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:05,732
He's the only man who truly
understands my fragrance.

23
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:08,485
I'll come back in 20 for those posters.

24
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,613
Oh, my God. Being famous is the worst.

25
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:15,367
-Ugh! Yeah, you're telling me.
-No, but, like, really famous.

26
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,786
-Uh...
-How can I explain it to someone like you?

27
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:21,957
I feel like all my friends only like me
because I'm Sarah Lynn, you know.

28
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,668
-Nobody cares about Sarah Lipschitz.
-Who's Sarah Lipschitz?

29
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,587
The lawyer who helped me change
my name from Sarah Helmulfarb.

30
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:28,505
Oof!

31
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:32,259
It is so great to see a real friend
who knew me before I got huge

32
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,177
and isn't just trying
to get something out of me.

33
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,095
Right.

34
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,180
I swear you are, like,
the only one I have left.

35
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:40,684
I am this close to falling off
the deep end. [laughs]

36
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:44,479
I know I'm smiling right now,
but the light inside me is dying.

37
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:45,397
Uh, what?

38
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,609
But here I am blah-blah-blah-ing
about my own boring, sexy, thrilling life.

39
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,485
What is going on with you?

40
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:54,197
Well, actually, I'm doing this new show,
<i>The BoJack Horseman Show.</i>

41
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:57,117
-I don't know if you've seen it or--
-Ugh, I'm so busy with the tour.

42
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,870
Yeah, no, of course, no,
but it's been a lot of fun.

43
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:03,415
The ratings aren't great,
but we have this upcoming episode,

44
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,960
and we're looking
for a really big guest star.

45
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:10,088
Oh. You want me to be on your show?

46
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:15,552
Well, I just thought it would
be really fun for... the both of us.

47
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,138
You know, like the old days.

48
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:22,267
I have the script with me
if you want to take a look at it.

49
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:25,228
Um, okay. Why don't you put it
on that pile over there?

50
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,564
And I'll get to it
when I have some free time.

51
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,066
-Over here?
-Yeah.

52
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,818
I'd love to keep hanging out,
but these doctors need their posters,

53
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,403
and I'm already pretty exhausted.

54
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:34,529
You should probably go.

55
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:37,324
-Oh, okay.
-It's all very exhausting.

56
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,617
Thanks again for coming.

57
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,079
Like I said, it's always nice
to see a... you.

58
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,580

Hey, is that character actress
Margo Martindale?

72

She's on the FBI's Most Wanted list

that always make everything better.

-We gotta call this in, right?
-That depends.

75

Blimp pilots, sir.

But the big opening

How can I offer the real Italian cuisine
without my real Italian spaghett'?

89

Spaghett' is how Italian people
say "spaghetti."

We'll get you your pasta.

91

He might have friends in the Mob.

92

have known for years.

Character actress Margo Martindale
ain't afraid of nothin'!

101
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,937
The boats are about to collide!
We have to do something!

102
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,981
You know damn well,
when we took to the sky,

103
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,317
we made a solemn oath never to meddle
in the affairs of land nor sea.

104
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,111
We are sworn but to observe.

105
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,696
This is the blimper's promise.

106
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:06,116
Oh, no! The boats
are tearing each other apart!

107
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,452
Crates and crates of spaghetti
are pouring out into the ocean!

108
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,539
I'm watching the same boat collision
you are. You don't need to narrate it.

109
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,583

Oh!

111
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,133
Oh, no!

112
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,760
The pasta is cooking!

113
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:29,848
If only we had some olive oil
to reduce the stickiness.

114
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:33,852
But olive oil doesn't actually
reduce the stickiness in pasta.

115
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,687
That's only a myth.

116
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,733
No! I've wasted so much of my life

117
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:43,695
stirring olive oil into pasta!

118
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:48,158
Disaster <i>al dente</i>
off the coast of San Clemente!

119
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,827
Twelve tons of pasta
have leaked into the ocean,

120
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:55,081
and the massive carbo load
is heading straight to Pacific Ocean City.

00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,252
Joining us via Google Hangout

123
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,630
is spaghetti scientist Carla Hall.

124
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:04,883
-What can you tell us, Carla?
-Well, Tom, as the spaghetti cooks,

125
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,093
it will expand, smothering the town

126
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,971
and tenderly broiling the sea life
who reside there.

127
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,514
Is there any way to prevent

128
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,684
this delicious-sounding
environmental catastrophe?

129
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,186
The only hope for rescue would be

130
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,105
if someone had an enormous quantity
of spaghetti strainers

131
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,523
just sitting around the house,

132
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,902
but that person would also need
access to a fleet of drivers

133
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,904
to transport said spaghetti strainers,

134
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,239
and in order to strain
the spaghetti fast enough,

135
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:31,076
the drivers would also need to be
incredibly strong swimmers,

136
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,954
like, just as an example,
hot, sexy killer whales.

137
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,623
Is there such a savior
who could possibly fit

138
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,668
that ridiculously specific
set of criteria?

139
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:44,255
I don't know, Tom, but as they used to say
on my favorite TV show, let's find out.

140
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:50,512

00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:57,328
Ninety-eight messages?
Better listen to them all, in order.

[Todd] <i>Mr. Peanutbutter, call me back</i>

<i>It's a spaghetti-strainer-related</i>
<i>emergency.</i>

172
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,555
All right, buddy, just as soon as I listen
to these other 96 messages.

If we don't get some kind of miracle--

179
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,110
Wait! In the distance! Is that--?

180
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,029
No, it can't be!

181
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,951
Spaghetti or not, here I come.

Uh-oh! Uh-oh!

Sabrina, I'm coming down

Oh, no!

186
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,924
Well, I've heard of

190
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:03,228
I thought if you knew I made a big mess
that you wouldn't love me anymore.

191

-[audience] Aw!
-Sabrina, that's not going to happen.

192
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,690
We're a family now, no matter what,

193
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,026
and I will always be there for you.

194
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:10,944
Okay.

196
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,948
Now, get in that kitchen
and eat all that spaghetti.

197
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,785
I gotta eat all that?
That's too much, man!

[studio audience applauds]

199
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,623
I never understood why
the <i>Horsin' Around</i> house

200
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,333
-had two sets of stairs.
-What?

201
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,169
One in the living room
and one in the kitchen. Why?

202
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,046
Have you ever been in a house like that?

203
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,715
-What are you doing here?
-You didn't answer your phone.

204
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,800
I was worried about you.

205
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,094
[takes deep breath]

206
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:39,305
The funeral was huge.
There were so many people there.

207
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,850
I kept thinking, "I did this to her,"

208
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:45,186
and everyone was just standing around
like, "Well, this was bound to happen,"

209
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,772
but... it wasn't bound to happen.

210
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,941
I'm really sorry, BoJack.

211
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,317
I don't know how to be, Diane.

212
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,653
It doesn't get better
and it doesn't get easier.

213
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,781
I can't keep lying to myself,
saying "I'm gonna change." I'm poison.

214
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,616
-BoJack--
-I come from poison.

215
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,786
I have poison inside me,
and I destroy everything I touch.

216
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,163
That's my legacy.

217
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,290
I have nothing to show
for the life that I've lived,

218
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,917
and I have nobody in my life
who's better off for having known me.

219
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,336
-That isn't true.
-Isn't it, though?

220
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,088
[sighs]

221
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:15,758
When I was a kid,
I used to watch you on TV.

222
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,261
And you know I didn't have
the best family.

223
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,138
Things weren't that great for me.

224
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:23,766
But, for half an hour every week,
I got to watch this show

225
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,603
about four people who had nobody,

226
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,772
who came together and became a family.

227
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:33,735
And, for half an hour every week,
I had a home,

228
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,862
and it helped me survive.

229
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:41,200
BoJack, there are millions of people
who are better off for having known you.

230
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,536
Why did you never tell me that?

231
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,415
I guess to preserve some fiction
of journalistic objectivity.

232
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,918
-Like that's a thing.
-I know you don't want to hear this,

233
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,879
but you're too good to be writing
Instagram captions for celebrities.

234
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,714
-I'm not just--
-I'm sorry, but you are.

235
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,133
-You know you are.
-Okay. Thank you.

236
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,803
And I wish you didn't get so distant
after you moved out.

237
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:03,973
-I'm sorry.
-You know me better than anybody,

238
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,392
and you can't not be a part of my life.

239
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,357
Tools! This is Brad.

240
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,776
-I want to do <i>Ethan Around.</i>
-Oh, very funny.

241
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,486
Is this Jeff from Hammers and More?

242
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,947
-No, it's me, BoJack Horseman.
-Wait, really?

243
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,492
Yeah. I think now more than ever
people need shows like <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

244
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,620
I... need a show like <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

245
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,665
Okay, but this isn't
like last time, is it?

246
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,333
Where you say you want to do it,

247
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,502
but then, I find out
you don't actually want to do it,

248
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,420
and then, your mean publicist yells at me?

249
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,923
And, at the airport, on the way home,
I get one of those big pretzels,

250
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,591
but then, I drop the pretzel
on the ground,

251
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,551
and it gets eaten by a ant?

252
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:41,719
What? No.

253
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,429
You won't regret this, BoJack.

254
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,183
Attention, customers!
Please leave and never come back.

255
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,395

I'm going Hollywoo!

[gasps]

257
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,566
Please, please! I'm no hero.

258
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,944
I'm just a guy
with some bowls full of holes.

259
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,404
Thanks again.

260
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,198
It's funny. You help out
at one disaster area,

261
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,909
and, suddenly, everybody loves you,
unless you're Sean Penn.

262
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,786
Great PR for Cabracadabra, too.

263
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:10,081
Yeah, you can't buy that kind of press,
and you can buy most kinds of press.

264
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,500
I hope some of that press
makes its way to this reader

265
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,294
because she is not a fan
of Cabracadabra.

266
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:19,424
-She hates it.
-I don't hate Cabracadabra.

267
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,842
I just think it objectifies women

268
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:24,262
and contributes to a cheap and damaging
culture of sexist commodification

269
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:27,015
that undercuts the exact reason
it was started in the first place.

270
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:28,725
But, you know, everything does that.

271
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:33,062
<i>Cosmo </i>does that.
Kids' movies, athletic gear... statues.

272
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:37,191
Yes, but this objectification of women
ended up saving lots of lives,

273
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:41,696
many of whom were also women,
so, therefore, not sexist?

274
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,656
I can't argue with that.

275
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,783
Well, the good news is,
you don't have to anymore,

276
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,452
because I'm selling the company!

277
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,369
[both]
Oh!

278
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,621
You know, it's really too bad
you shut down the agency,

279
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,957
because, if you could've held out
for just a couple more months,

280
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,084
right now,
Vim would be rolling in money.

281
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,128
I'm really happy for you,

282
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,464
but I'm actually enjoying my time off.

283
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,132
Ralph and I went on vacation.

284
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,176
Can you believe this one
had never been to Cairo?

285
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,720
Those Egyptians really know
how to treat a cat.

286
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:09,182
And what do you do, Ralph,
that you can just hop on a plane to Cairo?

287
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,768
Well, I own and operate
my own greeting card company,

288
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,686
but everywhere I go, I have a free room.

289
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,773
-Oh, because you're a mouse?
-What? No.

290
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:20,234
-Because I'm a Stilton.
-Oh, my God! Like Stilton hotels?

291
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:22,487
-[ringtone playing]
-I gotta take this. It's my new agent.

292
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,113
-Hello?
-So, anyway--

293
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,240
[Mr. Peanutbutter]
Another offer? That's incredible!

294
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,326
-Ralph and I--
-They want to pay me how much?

295
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,453
That is a lot of zeroes. Sign me up.
[laughing]

296
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,622
What is he doing?
You never take the first offer.

297
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,832
[clears throat]
Hey, Diane, what have you been up to?

298
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,876
Well, I'm just weighing my options.

299
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,670
-I don't want to just jump into my next--
-You know what you should do?

300
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:42,215
Ralph's sister Stefani
is starting a new website.

301
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:47,470
It's a feminism/lifestyle/celebrity blog/
newsletter/community hub,

302
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:52,183
and she's looking for a partner/editor/
"bomb-ass super bitch," her words.

303
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,352
You'd be perfect for it.
I'll set a meeting.

304
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,105
Yeah, that could be cool.
Why don't you give her my info?

305
00:14:57,188 --> 00:15:01,317
No, no. I'll just set a meeting.
It's easy. I'm not doing anything else.

306
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,653
-Except enjoying your time off, right?
-Right.

307
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,947
Wow, another amazing offer!

308
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,074
It's like everywhere I look,
money, money, money!

309
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,660
Even ten percent of this
would be quite a windfall.

310
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,577
[groans]

311
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:16,958
-I like your friends.
-Yeah.

312
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,042
And I like this.

313
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:19,085
[both]
Mwah!

314
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,003
-This is working.
-I like it, too.

315
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,423
That was smart of you
to think of Diane for GirlCrush.

316
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:24,799
You're always making great connections.

317
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,384
That's probably why you were
such a good manager.

318
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,679
-I wasn't a manager. I was an agent.
-Oh, right. Sorry.

319
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,597
Well, whatever it was,
I'm glad that it's over,

320
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,516
because I don't want
to share you with anybody.

321
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,685
Oh, my God!
Maybe that was the problem!

322
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,896
-Maybe what was the problem?
-All this time, I thought I was an agent,

323
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,983
but what if what I was really
supposed to be was a manager?

324
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,861
-What's the difference?
-It's a completely different line of work.

325

An agent helps a client find jobs,

326
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:49,574
but a manager helps manage
a client's career.

327
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,118
-It sounds exactly the same.
-I think I'm having an epiphany.

the wrong bra size this whole time.

Okay, if this is the thing
that'll make you happy,

330
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,666
then I totally support you,

331
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:02,879
but it kind of sounds like you're just
going back to the same sort of job

332
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,630
that made you miserable
for the last 20 years.

333
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,924
No, Ralph. Don't you get it?
This is a new beginning.

334
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:10,011
-I'm gonna be a manager!
-Oh...

335
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,432
-Wow.
-Takes you back, doesn't it?

336
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,559
Listen, before everyone
gets here tomorrow,

337
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,768
I have a couple notes on the script.

338
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,438
Too many "yowza-yowza bo-bowzas,"
or not enough?

339
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,106
No. On page 18,

Ethan and the Horse try to get Julia
to put on the roller skates,

341
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,068
and she runs out of the room crying,

342
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,904
and then, the Horse says,
"That went well."

343
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:32,325
-Anything about that feel weird to you?
-No, see, the Horse is being sarcastic.

344
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,495
It didn't go well. So, when the Horse
says, "That went well," it's funny.

345
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,747
-Dramatic irony.
-No, I get the irony.

346
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,583
That's not the issue.
This is a guaranteed laugh.

-And that's a problem for you?

-I don't know, BoJack.

You really think I'm ready
for a "That went well"?

351

-You tell me. Let's hear it.
-That went well!

352
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,059
You're pushing too hard.
The line's funny. Trust the line.

-That went well.
-Great. Now let me hear you throw it away.

354
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,856
-Oh, like a-- That went well.
-Yes, that was great!

355
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,691
And that was a great look,
with the eyebrow.

356
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,485

-Yeah, yeah.

"Now you see what I had to go through."

00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:16,369
-Exactly. Let's try it.
-Well, that went well.

Sorry, did you say "croosh"?

Oh, you do not need
to apologize here, Diane.

372
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:46,983
"Sorry" is a crutch
and "crutch" is an ableist term.

I'm sorry if that shocks you,
but I will not apologize for it.

the business model is here?

Diane, I'm rich.
I'm not doing this to make money.

I'm gonna talk to him about it directly.

and he didn't listen,

and you knew that,
as much as you love him

and as much as he loves you,
he's never gonna get it?

that all your readers looked up to you
