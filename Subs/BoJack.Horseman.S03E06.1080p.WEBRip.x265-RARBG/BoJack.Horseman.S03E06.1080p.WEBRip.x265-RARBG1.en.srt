1
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,427
...fucker!

2
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:18,101
-So, we have some options.
-Yeah, a lot of options to discuss.

3
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,562
-You know I love you.
-That's not what this is about.

4
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:23,232
We always agreed
we didn't want kids, unless--

5
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:25,108
A streetwise but soulful teen
needed somewhere to live

6
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:26,610
as he waited
for his Juilliard audition.

7
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,488
We'd support his dancing and let him
stay in the guest room, right.

8
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:32,157
-But a baby? Are you--?
-It's not about me.

9
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:34,868
There's no "I" in uterus,
there's only "us."

10
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:37,246
And "U," and another "U,"

11
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:40,457
but that's the "U" that's in "us,"
so I already said that "U."

12
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:43,752
The point is,
I'm going to be here for you, 24/7.

13
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:47,965
Two hundred and forty-seven percent,
that's how "there for you" I'll be.

14
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,842
-Whatever you decide...
-What we decide, because this is--

15
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:54,012
Definitely. This is a conversation.

16
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:58,475
Let's both say what we want
at the same time on three.

17
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,978
-Okay.
-One, two--

18
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,354
On three or after three?

19
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:05,357
How could I say it "on three"?
I'll be saying "three."

20
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,485
-Okay. Okay.
-One, two, three...

21
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:09,778
-Abortion.
-Get an abortion.

22
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:12,364
Oh, no. We said different things.

41

If you were an airline

Hey, yo, Scott!

00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,036
Hey, Diane.

47
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,373
-Diane, Diane, Diane.
-I'm doing my job, BoJack.

48
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,624
Young people and their phones.

49
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,210
There could be a beautiful rainbow
in this room right now

50
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,503
and you would have no idea.

51
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:32,838
Really makes you think, huh?

52
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,631
Can you look at rainbows on your phone?

53
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,341
Shut up, BoJack.

54
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:37,551
Shit.

55
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,095
I just tweeted "Shut up, BoJack,"
as Cynthia Nixon.

56
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,347
I'd buy it. She is not a fan,
and for good reason.

57
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:45,392
-We were up in the Poconos, she and I...
-BoJack, not now.

58
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,686
-What's up your butt tonight?
-You really wanna know?

59
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,188
I would seriously like to know
what crawled up your butt,

60
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:52,107
made a home for itself in your butt,

61
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,193
started a family, lived a fruitful life,
and then died up your butt.

62
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:56,570
I'm getting an abortion.

63
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,530
Whoa, that takes me back.

64
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,991
I had more than my share of abortions
in the '90s.

65
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,784
I didn't get them, I paid for them.

66
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:05,162
I really hope all those women
actually got the abortions,

67
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,330
and didn't just keep my money.

68
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,917
Diane, are you tweeting for pop starlet
Sextina Aquafina right now?

69
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,252
I'm trying to. Why?

70
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:15,797
Because her account
just tweeted out to 40 million followers,

71
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,340
"I'm getting an abortion."

72
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:18,258
What? No--

73
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,551
She--

74
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:20,552
Oh, balls.

75
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,680
The tweet heard round the world.

76
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,892
Sextina Aquafina says,
"I'm getting an abortion."

77
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:30,103
And the world says, "Whaaa?"

78
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:31,980
If it's happening,
we're gonna talk about it.

79
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,940
It's time for Tom's Rant.

80
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,943
Is Twitter an appropriate forum

81
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,321
to be discussing a sensitive issue
like abortion?

82
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,157
Wouldn't a better forum be nowhere?

83
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,495
Wait, does that say "Tom Srant"?
Why does that say Tom Srant?

84
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:47,579
I clearly said--

85
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,248
Randy, don't look at Jessica.
This is on you.

86
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:56,546
Diane, VIM is hanging on by a thread
and only barely scraping by

87
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,173
because of clients like Sextina.

88
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:01,468
Hey! Heard you pulled the trigger
on the Big Bear condo.

89
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,429
Great investment.
We are not on the edge of complete ruin.

90
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,723
We are on the edge of complete ruin.

91
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,935
I think if I explain it to her
and apologize, she'll understand.

92
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:13,438
Because she's so understanding?
This is a teenage pop star.

93
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,649
Literally the two least
compassionate entities

94
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,109
combined into the supernova
of not understanding

95
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:20,737
that is Sextina Aquafina.

96
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:24,699
Ugh. So imagine my surprise

97
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:28,620
when I'm in the middle of a performance
for Gaddafi's cousin on his yacht

98
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,791
and I'm in a giant champagne flute
singing "Left Titty"

99
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,585
and everyone starts to look
at their phones and look at me,

100
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:39,047
because I am apparently aborting a baby
I do not have.

101
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:44,177
So I had them turn their boat into a car
and drive me here to fire someone.

102
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:47,305
-I think that's me.
-Great. You're fired, Glasses.

<i>♪ Sextina! ♪</i>

104
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:52,978
I'll put out a statement
explaining the whole mess. I am so sorry.

105
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,104
Oh. Oh!

106
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,939
What "oh?" Who said you could "Oh?"

107
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,776
Taylor Swift just tweeted
that you were "brave."

108
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,654
Nicki Minaj tweeted at you
a face with heart eyes.

109
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,657
And BuzzFeed just posted a list
of top 15 celebrities

110
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,617
who should have had abortions
like Sextina.

111
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:11,162
-You're trending like crazy.
-I'm trending?

112
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,582
Most women who go through this
never talk about it

113
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:14,916
because it's so stigmatized.

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,586
The fact that you're coming out like this
is huge.

115
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,796
It would be, if you were
actually getting an abortion.

116
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:24,259
So what you're saying is,
maybe I <i>am </i>getting an abortion?

117
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,636
Well, no, because you're not.

118
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,681
Yeah, but if you did,
this would make you a cultural icon.

119
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:33,310
Glasses, you're un-fired.
I'm getting an abortion.

120
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,020
-Well...
-I gotta go on talk shows.

121
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:38,273
If I can make one woman
feel a little less alone,

122
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,941
then it's all worth it, right?

123
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,067
Yeah...

124
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,029
And if I can make a million women
buy my album,

125
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,739
then it's definitely all worth it.

126
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:46,656
Um...

127
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,658
-Diane, take the yes.
-Okay.

128
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:53,038
Sextina Aquafina, you are now the face
of the pro-choice movement.

129
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:56,541
-Now let's get you informed.
-Hey! Uh, what?

130
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,212
So, before the procedure,

131
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:04,007
you'll need to look at an ultrasound
and listen to the heartbeat.

132
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,925
Or heartbeats, if you're having a litter.

133
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,677
Why does she have to listen
to the heartbeat?

134
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:11,181
It's the law. Also, by law,
I have to tell you that at one month,

135
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,559
your puppies have a favorite color
and that color may be blue.

136
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:17,562
-That can't be true.
-By law, I have to tell you that.

137
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:18,813
Also, before your procedure,

138
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,316
you'll need to watch
20 hours of cute puppy videos

139
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,319
as Sarah McLachlan's
"I Will Remember You" plays softly.

140
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,322
Don't worry, Diane, I will watch
the cute puppy videos for you.

141
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:30,617
-It's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.
-No, she has to watch the videos.

142
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,454
Don't worry, Diane, we will watch
the cute puppy videos together.

143
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:38,458
-No, she has to watch them alone.
-Diane, I have some terrible news.

144
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:45,840
Tomorrow, our exclusive interview
with the irrepressible provocateuse

145
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,759
Sextina Aquafina.

146
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:52,222
But first, one thing that isn't
being aborted: the road to Oscar.

147
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,349
Tonight, the Leonard Maltin Awards.

148
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,685
Handing out trophies
to all the performances this year

149
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:59,104
that Leonard Maltin thought
were pretty good.

150
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:04,901
And the Malty for Pretty Good Actor
goes to Bread Poot.

151
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,237
Whoo!

152
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,913
You need another drink?

153
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:20,417
Why? Because I lost, I'm a loser,
so I have to drown my sorrows in scotch?

154
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,086
No, I just meant because of thirst.

155
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,295
I could use a scotch.

156
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,007
Oh, look. Jurj Clooners.

157
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,800
There he is, Jurj Clooners.

158
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,635
Hey, how are you? Thank you.

159
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,762
Jurj sucks.
What does everyone love about him?

160
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,974
He's not a god.
He's just an old guy who loves pranks.

161
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,726
Sure sounds like God.

162
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,395
-Jurj, hey, man.
-BoJack, right?

163
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,480
Yeah, good to see you.

164
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:47,277
Hey, Jurj, my name's Todd,
and my friend Keith sleeps on your couch.

165
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,821
Oh, you know Keith?
Tell him to clean up his shit.

166
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,656
Oh.

167
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,241
That is so Keith.

168
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,703
Todd, why don't you do the grown-ups
a favor and go find your own shadow?

169
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,122
It was here a second ago.

170
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,333
Jurj, I loved you
in <i>The Nazi Who Played Yahtzee.</i>

171
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,794
How do you get in the head
of a war criminal?

172
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,422
You know,
I don't think of him as a war criminal.

173
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,467
I just think of him as a person
who had a funny accent.

174
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,094
Totally. I think I'm getting
the hang of all this now.

175
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:17,724
You won last night, the other guy
won tonight, maybe I'll win next time.

176
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:21,269
Yikes.
Look, man, you're not gonna be next.

177
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:24,022
This will sound dumb
coming out of my mouth, but it's true.

178
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:29,027
So Jurj, Bread, Mitt, those are names.
Like real names.

179
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,654
Lernernerner DiCarpricorn, that's a name.

180
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,698
-BoJack, not a name.
-Huh.

181
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,076
I figured they would, like,
tell you this stuff.

182
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,495
You're the Fifth Man. You get it, right?

183
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,789
-Well--
-Yeah, you get it. Put her there.

184
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:41,873
Oh!

185
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:45,085
Joy buzzer. You just got Jurjed!

186
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,961
All right, I'll see you later.

187
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:51,841
Vivica.
Now I know why they call you A. Fox.

188
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,552
Excuse me, you gonna stay here long?

189
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:57,138
We got the OCD Image Awards tomorrow,

190
00:09:57,222 --> 00:10:00,433
and those guys really like
a clean afterparty.

191
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,606
So, let me get this straight, Sextina.

192
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,067
Someone put a baby in your belly
and now you're like,

193
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,528
"Awooga!
Is there an undo button around here?

194
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,071
Leggo my preggo."

195
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:16,116
-Is that right?
-That is exactly correct, A Ryan,

196
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:20,578
but I am very excited for this opportunity
to put a face on this important issue.

197
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:23,790
One out of three women
will have an abortion in her life.

198
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,501
That sounds crazy high to me,
I don't buy it.

199
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:29,921
I wanted to destigmatize the experience
for all women out there,

200
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,173
so I'm dropping a new single.

201
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,716
-What?
- <i>♪ Surprise! ♪</i>

202
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,802
-New single?
-Just relax.

203
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,097
Crack an egg on your head,
feel the yolk drip down.

204
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,474
America, get your uteruses turnt,

205
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:44,602
'cause this song is called
"Get Dat Fetus Kill Dat Fetus."

206
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:45,728
Oh, dear.

207
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:49,232
♪ <i>I'm a baby killer</i>
<i>Baby killing makes me horny ♪</i>

208
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,318
♪ <i>Alien's inside me</i>
<i>I'm gonna squash it like Sigourney ♪</i>

209
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,154
No, stop.

210
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,156
♪ <i>Get that fetus, kill that fetus ♪</i>

211
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,074
♪ <i>Brrap brrap pew pew... ♪</i>

212
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,326
Christ, stop the tape.

213
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:04,330
Glasses, you did this.
You empowered me to tell my story.

214
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:08,960
I think the tone might be a little severe?

215
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:12,881
Look, when you get an abortion,
you can express yourself however you want,

216
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:15,508
but this is about my body and my choices,

217
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:19,596
and my choice
is to be a totally insane badass.

218
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,599
Ugh! I <i>am </i>getting an abortion.
You're not even really pregnant.

219
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:26,477
So? This is show business.
"Brrap brrap. Pew pew."

220
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,690
"Brrap brrap. Pew pew."

221
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:34,319
A daring battle cry from
the self-appointed New Voice of Choice.

222
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,906
But has the concept of women
having choices gone too far?

223
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:40,783
We've assembled this diverse panel
of white men in bow ties

224
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,660
to talk about abortion. Gentlemen?

225
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,246
Tom, this is not just a woman's issue.

226
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,415
I'm a man, but if I got pregnant,

227
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:51,461
would I put my life on hold
for a child I didn't want? Yes, I would.

228
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,837
I can say that with confidence,

229
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:56,007
because I will never have to make
that decision, so I'm unbiased.

230
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,677
-Does this video glamorize abortion?
-Very possibly, Tom.

231
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,972
Millennials today think everything is NBD.

232
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:07,101
NBD of course stands for No BD,
referring to B.D. Wong,

233
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:09,437
who teens think is a very big deal.

234
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:14,233
So if something's not BD,
it means it's not a big deal.

235
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:19,447
-These days, abortions are not BD.
-Are abortions even necessary?

236
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:23,034
I heard a theory that if a woman
really has an unwanted pregnancy,

237
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:26,120
the body has a way to break the fetus down
into gas particles

238
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:28,122
and then she can just fart it out.

239
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:31,459
Where did you hear this intriguing
"fart it out" theory?

240
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:35,296
-I don't remember. Maybe the Bible?
-Thank you for clarifying.

241
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,549
Next up, Jurj Clooners
is making audiences cry

242
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:42,512
in his new film, but his latest prank
might make you... think?

243
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,264
Jurj. He likes pranks, huh?

244
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,934
I'll prank him. I'll prank him real good.

245
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,436
We'll need to draw him out.
What do A-list actors like?

246
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,563
Stretch limos? Nannies?

247
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:56,859
Flying their private jets
to disaster areas so they can "help out"?

248
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,403
Yeah, limos. We'll get a limo.

249
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,655
I'll need one of those caps,
I'll be the driver.

250
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,282
I'll pick him up,
and he'll be all like, "I'm Jurj, I suck,"

251
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:06,160
and then I'll be all, "Surprise,"
and hit him with a bat.

252
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:07,328
Pranked!

253
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:11,624
It really doesn't seem like a prank
as much as you hitting him with a bat.

254
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:15,336
Yeah, it's a bad prank on purpose
to show how stupid pranks are.

255
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,672
-That's the point.
-Is that the point?

256
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,508
I'm working on levels here, man.
To the limousine repository.

257
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,930
Good afternoon, Mr. Clooners.

258
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:28,808
Hey, man, just one sec,
my publicist is right behind me.

259
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,477
Of course. Bring the publicist.

260
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:34,856
-Oh, shit.
-What's that, driver?

261
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:39,068
I said, "Auschwitz."
You're the Nazi who played Yahtzee.

262
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:43,031
Right, well, anyway, we're going
to the AOL-Time-Warner-PepsiCo-Viacom

263
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:46,075
Halliburton-Skynet-Toyota-Trader Joe's
Auditorium

264
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,910
for the Image Choice Spirit Awards.

265
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:52,790
Uh... okay, yes, ma'am.
Here I go. Driving, driving.

266
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:55,293
You don't need to talk,
you can just drive.

267
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,170
Actually, can we make a couple stops?

268
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,840
I am totally out of toilet paper,
so if you could find a Rite Aid.

269
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:05,928
You have to go in and buy the TP for me.
I'll get mobbed by fans if I go in.

270
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,264
Just pick out something
extra soft for my tushy.

271
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,892
-I don't know
-Do as he says, driver.

272
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,644
-Chop chop.
-Okay.

273
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,442
My concern is that you're
actually giving the pro-life movement

274
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,486
something to latch onto
as an example of--

275
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,905
Oh, my God, you are so boring.

276
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,491
Can I abort talking to you right now?
Abort.

277
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,827
-You need to stop and think--
-Or what? You gonna sic Fido on me?

278
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:32,497
I am just here for emotional support.

279
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,416
Can you let it go?
I don't want to have to ask you again.

280
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,835
I really think we have the chance
to say something here,

281
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,339
and all we're saying
is "Pshew pshew pow."

282
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,840
-What is that?
-What are you doing?

283
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:44,509
That's the gun sounds, from the song.

284
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,095
Uh. Do you mean, "Brrap brrap pew pew"?

285
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:49,639
Yeah, that's what I did. "Pshow, kapow."

286
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,682
-That's not what a gun sounds like.
-Prrow!

287
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,434
-Pshow, kapow!
-Bop!

288
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,228
-Brrap brrap pew pew!
-Ppew, ping!

289
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,563
Can everyone please
stop making gun sounds?

290
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,232
It is really freaking me out.

291
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,734
My point is,
everyone's listening to you now.

292
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,570
Soon people are gonna get bored
and move onto the next thing

293
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:07,115
and you'll hate yourself
that you weren't able to make a difference

294
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:08,408
when you had the chance.

295
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,868
Believe me,
it happens sooner than you think.

296
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:12,412
Oh...

297
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,164
Hi. I'm A Ryan Sea--

298
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,460
Okay, we're here, finally. Get out.

299
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,421
Ooh, can we make one more stop?

300
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:24,090
I just remembered
we left my wife back at the house.

301
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,050
Can we go back? Pwease?

302
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,302
Driver? The man said, "Pwease."

303
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:32,807
That's it. Enough.
I am not your driver. It is I, BoJack.

304
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,601
BoJack? What are you doing?

305
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:38,396
I was gonna prank Jurj
by hitting him with this bat,

306
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:42,024
but you got into the car because,
apparently, you are a two-timing liar.

307
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,734
What's the thing with the bat?

308
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:46,028
BoJack, this is not a good look on you.

309
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,030
All this time,
I thought you believed in me.

310
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,741
This is why your clients win every year.
You represent everyone.

311
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,369
It has nothing to do with whether
you're a good publicist or not.

312
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,371
I am a marvelous publicist.

313
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,541
Not to me. You're doing great work
for this asshole who loves pranks.

314
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,876
You're pranking him right now.

315
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,045
Yeah, with a bad prank
to show how stupid pranks are.

316
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,006
Seems a little convoluted,

317
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,633
which is actually a trademark
of a great prank.

318
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:09,051
Well played, sir.

319
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:12,013
No, it's a bad prank.
That's my point. Pranks are dumb.

320
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:15,391
We're late, and I won't keep going
round and round with you on this.

321
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,185
Publicists have many clients.

322
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:18,978
Not my publicist. You're fired.

323
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,522
Are you kidding?
Who fires Ana Spanakopita?

324
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:22,690
I do. I just did.

325
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,651
Who's gonna set up
your press appearances?

326
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:28,029
Your hopeless agent? Your idiot sidekick?

327
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,323
Not your problem.
Get the hell out of my limo.

328
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,493
'Cause I gotta pick up
a bachelorette party in 30 minutes.

329
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:38,748
Sextina, welcome to the program.
Can I get a "pew pew" for the fans?

330
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:43,169
-Tom, abortion is a very serious subject.
-Yes, very serious, I agree.

331
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,463
I want to tell the real story
about abortion,

332
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,298
show America what it's really about,

333
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:50,343
which is why your girl Sextina Aquafina

334
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,971
is gonna have her abortion
live on television.

335
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:55,097
What what?

336
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,683
Pay-per-view, chitches.

337
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:58,893
-What?
-What?

338
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:02,480
"Pay-per-view, chitches."
Brrap brrap, pew pew, ka-ching ka-ching.

339
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,233
How are you going to have
an abortion on live TV

340
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,943
when you're not even
really having an abortion?

341
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,737
-Duh, we'll just <i>Argo </i>that shit.
-What does that mean?

342
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,533
Yeah, yeah. Fake abortion.
Movie magic, like in <i>Argo.</i>

343
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,409
That is not what happened in <i>Argo.</i>

344
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:18,079
If we're gonna do this,
we got to be real tasteful.

345
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:21,791
Yeah, only the best for my abortion.
All class.

346
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,709
John Carpenter
can do the practical effects.

347
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,419
-He owes me a favor.
-What?

348
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,797
We'll book Eddie Redmayne as the fetus.

349
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,173
Are you hearing yourselves?

350
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:32,635
We're not going to fake an abortion
on live TV.

351
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,220
Obviously, we'll pre-tape it.

352
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,306
Then put a little box in the corner
of the screen that says "Live."

353
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,976
You don't think
this is incredibly disrespectful

354
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,144
to the women who actually get abortions?

355
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,729
Not if we do it tasteful.

356
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:47,066
Diane, this is what the client wants.
Stop making it about you.

357
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,693
I'm not making it about me.

358
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,904
-I am so tired of you creating problems.
-I'm not--

359
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,739
I'm sorry you're so fertile

360
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:56,409
and in a sexually active,
loving relationship

361
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,119
and now you don't want a family.

362
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,955
-I'm sure that's really hard for you.
-What?

363
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,917
Uh... if this is not about me anymore,
then I'mma go.

364
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,378
Y'all figure your shit out
and get back at me.

365
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,380
Where's that ZZ Top mofo at?

366
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:12,466
Can a chitch
get a parking validation or what?

367
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,677
Is there something you want to say to me?

368
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:21,392
I have given everything to get where I am,
and I am not about to throw all that away.

369
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,020
She wants an abortion?
I'm getting her an abortion.

370
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,064
-You know this is bullshit.
-It's all bullshit, Diane.

371
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:31,861
That's the gig. And you're not good enough
at this job to be too good for this job.

372
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,613
I won't be a part of this.

373
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,075
Yo, Beardo, where did you go?

374
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:41,120
I need to get my parking validation did,
or I cannot leave.

375
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,539
Y'all's trippin' if you think
Sextina Aquafina

376
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:46,042
is paying $15 for parking.

377
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,505
All right, new publicist.
What do you got for me?

378
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:56,218
Secretariat was an athlete, right?
And you used to be an athlete.

379
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,428
What? No, I didn't.

380
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:01,223
You didn't play baseball and football?
Oh, um...

381
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,434
You know, I think I Googled the wrong guy.

382
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:07,772
-Did you think I was Bo Jackson?
-This idea I know you're going to like.

383
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,732
You know that car wash on Alvarado?

384
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:15,071
They need someone to dress up
like a gorilla and spin a sign.

385
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,364
Why would I do that?

386
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:18,741
Anything that gets your face
out there, right?

387
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,535
How does it get my face out there
dressed like a gorilla?

388
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:22,995
Maybe that one's a dud,

389
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,831
but hey, you think Lou Bega
knocked it out of the park

390
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,583
with "Mambo Number One"?

391
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:31,337
No, but he kept at it.

392
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:38,719
I'm making things all about me?
I'm the one who's having an abortion.

393
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:42,139
-It's ridiculous.
-They're completely morally bankrupt.

394
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,600
I agree with you, 247 percent.

395
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,936
I just wrote "morally bankrupt"
on this form.

396
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,564
You were right to do that.
This form is being very nosy right now.

397
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:52,108
Why did I even take that job?

398
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,569
You were going through a rough time,
Princess Carolyn wanted to help you

399
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,363
and she offered you the job.

400
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:01,200
Which she should not have done.
So morally bankrupt.

401
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,244
Okay, yeah, that was nice.

402
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,788
But still,
she is putting her company's bottom line

403
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,958
before the very real damage
that bottle-nosed maniac

404
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,127
is doing every time
she gets on the news and--

405
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,295
That's it, the news.

406
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:16,674
I gotta take the high road,
go on the news and rat those suckers out.

407
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,884
Is that really a good idea?

408
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,428
It is if you think it is,

409
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:22,805
because I am here to support you
no matter what,

410
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,808
but maybe it isn't the best idea?

411
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:30,396
Like, if that idea were a Dillon brother
maybe it's a Kevin, not a Matt?

412
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:34,066
Someone has to tell the world
that Sextina is a total fraud.

413
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,985
You know Sextina Aquafina?

414
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:40,990
-Oh. Yeah, I mean, I work with her.
-Oh. She is so cool.

415
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:45,703
Sextina's music makes me feel strong,
like I can do anything.

416
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:46,996
It doesn't offend you?

417
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,622
What about the part where she says,

418
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:51,417
"I hope and pray to God
my little fetus has a soul

419
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,045
'cause I want it to feel pain
when I eject it from my hole"?

420
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:58,007
It's a joke.
You get that it's a joke, right?

421
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,050
Well, obviously.

422
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:03,220
Do you think she actually wants
to shoot her fetus with a gun?

423
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:06,640
-No, I get it.
-Getting an abortion is scary.

424
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:08,350
With all the protesters out front,

425
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,644
how you have to listen
to the heartbeat and all that.

426
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:14,315
When you can joke about it,
it makes it less scary, you know?

427
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,650
Yeah.

428
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,027
Diane?

429
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:27,995
Ana?

430
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,040
I won't be working with Jurj anymore.

431
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,210
I let him know this morning.

432
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,587
First he thought I was doing
a really good prank,

433
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,547
but eventually I think he understood.

434
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,049
You dropped Jurj?

435
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,928
Jurj Clooners?
Sexiest Man in America Jurj Clooners?

436
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:47,223
Jurj is easy. Everyone loves him.

437
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,684
I've got a master's degree in Publicist,
it's time to put that to use.

438
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:53,771
I dropped all my other clients.
You're the underdog.

439
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:58,067
I want to put all my attention on you
and get you that Oscar.

440
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,069
So nobody else, huh? Good.

441
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,947
Just all your hopes and dreams
pinned on me.

442
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,490
Somehow beating the odds

443
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,993
and winning the highest possible accolade
in an actor's career.

444
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:10,371
-I know we can do it.
-Just me, huh?

445
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,790
Wow, that's actually. That--

446
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,834
Is someone standing on my windpipe?

447
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:17,002
Let's just get Jurj on the phone so we--

448
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,380
No, BoJack. I believe in you, okay?

449
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:21,048
Okay.

450
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,258
Whoa, Ana, what are you--?

451
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,094
-Oh, boy.
-Shh... It's okay.

452
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:29,265
-When you fired me, it was thrilling.
-Oh. Ana...

453
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,183
Nobody talks to me like that.

454
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:35,854
It reminded me that I work for you,
and I liked that.

455
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:36,981
Okay, but--

456
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:41,944
Do you like that?
Being in control? Being the star?

457
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,028
Yes.

458
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:46,240
You're my star, BoJack. My shining star.

459
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,367
-But don't you ever...
-Ow, too tight.

460
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,744
-...try to screw me again.
-Ouch! Oh, please.

461
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:53,080
-Do you understand?
-Yes. God, yes.

462
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,456
Good.

463
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:59,420
I'll see you tomorrow bright and early.
You have my undivided attention now.

464
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:02,756
Uh...

465
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,051
<i>How are you feeling, Sextina?</i>

466
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:09,096
<i>A little queasy</i>
<i>but on the whole, wonderful.</i>

467
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,557
<i>Good. Now, I do accept tips.</i>

468
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,686
-That was surprisingly tasteful.
-And educational, right?

469
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,605
Yeah. Weirdly educational.

470
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:22,860
I actually learned a lot about abortion,
and I just had an abortion.

471
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,070
-How are you feeling?
-I feel shitty.

472
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:26,614
I mean, physically.

473
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:30,451
I'm glad I did it,
but mostly I just felt old.

474
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,662
There were all these teenagers there.
Twenty-somethings.

475
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:37,541
I know from the outside, it might seem
like I should be ready for kids,

476
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:38,709
but I can't--

477
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:42,963
Diane, you don't need
to explain anything to anyone.

478
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:50,679
-Sextina. Great job, we did it.
<i>-Yeah, so, little wrinkle.</i>

479
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:53,182
I've been having a lot of sex, you know,

480
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,977
'cause I'm a sexual creature
and dolphins do have sex for pleasure.

481
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:59,480
I just found out
I got knocked up for real.

482
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:02,483
-What?
-And I think I want to keep it.

483
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,569
But that might be a little confusing
to my fans,

484
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:09,031
since they just saw me
get the old scoopity doopity?

485
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:12,868
Okay, we're gonna handle this.
Meet us at the office in 20 minutes.

486
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:16,955
First thing is we gotta get her
out of town before she starts to show.

487
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,584
Yeah, we'll send her to that farm
where celebrities go to disappear,

488
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:22,878
where Chad Michael Murray
