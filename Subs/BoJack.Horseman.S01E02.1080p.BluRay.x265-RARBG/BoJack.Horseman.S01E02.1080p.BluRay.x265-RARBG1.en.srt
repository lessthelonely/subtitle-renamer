1
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,639
Say when.

2
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:17,184
When.

3
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,394
Yeah, you'll never
guess who's here.

4
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:20,979
Think '90$.

5
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:24,691
No, bojack horseman
from horsin'around.

6
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,527
No, I mean,
he got a little fatter,

7
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,111
but it's definitely him.

8
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,697
He looks really sad.
It's hilarious.

9
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,408
Get over here now.

10
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,914
I told you,
I don't know where it is.

11
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:41,500
Don't put things in my butt
if you want them back.

12
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:45,837
And hold
for Princess Carolyn, please.

13
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,047
Thanks, Laura.

14
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:48,674
J“ when you're walking alone j”

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,261
j“ because jellicles are
and jellicles do j“

16
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,012
j“ jellicles do and jelli... j'

17
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,014
bojack,
it's your favorite agent.

18
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,821
Yeah, some agent,
you couldn't even get me

19
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,226
in the room for war horse.

20
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,073
There were, like,
ten horses in that movie.

21
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:02,729
I didn't need
to be the warhorse.

22
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,666
Listen, dummy, I want
to make sure you're all set

23
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,210
for your first day
with Diane tomorrow.

24
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:08,402
Is she gonna ask me
a bunch of personal questions?

25
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,779
The woman we're paying
to ghostwrite your memoir?

26
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:12,239
Yeah, probably.

27
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,116
Okay, all right,
there's no need to get...

28
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:16,285
What, catty?
Are you gonna say catty?

29
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:19,538
- I was not gonna say catty.
- Oh, what were you gonna say?

30
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:22,291
I was gonna say catty
because you're a cat.

31
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,126
Goodbye, bojack.

32
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:26,145
Laura, I know you're
listening. You got it, right?

33
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,046
Laura, do not respond to him.
Goodbye, bojack.

34
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:31,091
She got it.

35
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,388
Oh, my god. Take another one.

36
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:38,765
Take another one.

37
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:44,187
Excuse me,
I just wanted you to know

38
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,440
that you ruined
someone else's night tonight,

39
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,317
and I hope
you have enough decency

40
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,569
to at least feel
a little bit crappy about it.

41
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:51,862
Excuse me?

42
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,739
I was actually
already in a bad mood,

43
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,324
but I thought maybe
for one night,

44
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,368
I could go out to a bar
and try to forget about myself,

45
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,095
but now because of you
and your friends,

46
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,289
I feel more self-conscious
than ever.

47
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,736
If we were bothering you
so much,

48
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,334
why didn't you just leave?

49
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,669
Because I didn't think
of that, and now I feel stupid.

50
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,116
Look, I have a right to be here.

51
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:13,383
Maybe because you're skinny
and maybe 'cause you're pretty,

52
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,135
you're used to getting away
with things,

53
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,512
but I want you to know
that your actions

54
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,057
have an effect on others,
and I hate you,

55
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,933
and you are a horrible person,

56
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,936
and you not understanding
that you're a horrible person

57
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:29,066
doesn't make you
less of a horrible person.

58
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,609
You think I'm pretty?

59
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,637
Well, that was
another in a long series

60
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,329
of regrettable life choices.

61
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:43,955
What'd you say?

62
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,282
I was tweeting about all
the weird stuff you do in bed.

63
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:47,978
- Good morning.
- Ah!

64
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,145
Why are you here?

65
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,355
I slept here.

66
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:51,802
Yeah, but why
are you still here?

67
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,233
Breakfast.

68
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,080
That better not be
my last toaster strudel.

69
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,486
No, there were three left.

70
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,779
Well, get out of here.

71
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,865
My memoirist is
gonna show up soon,

72
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,450
and I don't need you...

73
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,243
- What's your name?
- Pam.

74
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,289
I don't need you Pam-ing
up the place when she gets here.

75
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,958
- Hey, bojack.
- Ah! Why are you here?

76
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,395
- You told me to come at 9:00.
- That doesn't sound like me.

77
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,254
I have your email right here.

78
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,215
"Diane, why don't you come over
Tuesday morning at 9:00?

79
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,092
“Also, you should bring
this email with you

80
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,903
"because I might not remember it
because I just took

81
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,013
“a bunch of horse tranquilizers,
ha ha.

82
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,500
"Also, please don't put
in my book

83
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,308
“that I use horse tranquilizers,
ha ha.

84
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,675
"I just use a small dose
to help me fall asleep at night

85
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,187
"and then
a much, much larger dose

86
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,772
"to get me through the day.

87
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,315
“Also, I'm drunk.

88
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:36,485
"Also, I'm alone,
so alone, so, so alone.

89
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,278
“Please don't put that
in my book,

90
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,822
“book, book, book 'em, dildo.

91
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,657
Does it taste like magenta
in here?"

92
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,544
Then I think you fell asleep
on the keyboard

93
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,745
because it just says
the letter "b" 27 times.

94
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,455
That does sound like me.

95
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,415
Well, anyway,
this is my businessperson...

96
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:51,958
Excuse me?

97
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,835
Here to help me
with some business needs.

98
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,837
- All very above board.
- Uh, what'd you say?

99
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,482
No need to mention her
in the book either,

100
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:58,632
unless it's a business book.

101
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,843
Ha ha, classic bojack.

102
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,637
Why are you here?

103
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:07,057
Oh, funny story, I'm filming
a reality show later,

104
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:11,102
so I thought I'd drop by with
the old tennis ball and chain.

105
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:14,064
That is neither funny
nor a story

106
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,982
nor a reason for you to drop by.

107
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,943
Aw, he just wanted
to come over and brag

108
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,486
about his reality show.

109
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,948
Get this, I am starring
in a pilot presentation

110
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,116
for a celebrity reality show.

111
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,483
It's pretty cutting edge, huh?

112
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,911
Yeah, if it's 2003.

113
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:30,497
Ha ha. Don't tell vh1 that.

114
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,916
Seriously, though,
please don't tell vh1 that.

115
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,418
We are calling it
peanutbutter and jelly.

116
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:36,919
Get it?

117
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,256
- Because I'm Mr. Peanutbutter.
- Okay, who's jelly?

118
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,108
No, no, no. It's like a peanut
butter and jelly sandwich.

119
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,384
It's wordplay.

120
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,071
You may have too forgiving
a definition

121
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,135
of the word "wordplay."

122
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:46,972
Well, it's a working title.

123
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,808
Well, it could be working
harder, and that's wordplay.

124
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,142
How'd you even get in here?

125
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,435
Your roommate let us in.

126
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,479
Mi casa es su casa.

127
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:56,565
And that is the last
of the toaster strudels,

128
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,066
and now my morning is ruined.

129
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,553
Could you guys
keep it down, okay?

130
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,361
I'm kind of on a date right now.

131
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,822
In america,

132
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:07,158
I am actually
considered very handsome.

133
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,161
Okay, I'm gonna
go get breakfast,

134
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,265
and when I get back,
I want everyone out of my house

135
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:17,544
except for you and you and...

136
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,631
- Who are you again?
- The girl you had sex with.

137
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,173
Right. You definitely should
have already been gone.

138
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,761
I really shouldn't eat chocolate

139
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,513
'cause it can literally kill me.

140
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,140
Oh, I know.

141
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:33,101
- But I love chocolate.
- Story of my life.

142
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,153
Hey, excuse me.

143
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,615
Yes, I am bojack horseman,
star of horsin'around.

144
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,116
Yeah, okay, I don't care.

145
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:49,701
Those are my muffins.

146
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,536
I'm sorry,
I... I don't understand.

147
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,747
Did you bring them
into the store with you?

148
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,291
No, but I was going to buy them.

149
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,251
That's the last box,
and I had dibs on them.

150
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,795
Really? You had dibs?

151
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,631
Yeah, dibs.

152
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,077
I just put them down
for a second

153
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,592
while I went to the bathroom.

154
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,159
Look, I don't even
want the muffins.

155
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,062
I was just looking at them,
but I got to say,

156
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,306
if you put muffins down,
they're not your muffins.

157
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:12,873
So what, I was supposed
to take them

158
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,392
into the bathroom with me?

159
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,269
You didn't even
put the muffins in a cart.

160
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,556
You just left them out here.

161
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,564
Yeah, in the produce section.

162
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:22,168
Clearly, muffins aren't supposed
to be in the produce section.

163
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,736
That wasn't a sign to you that
maybe someone else had dibs?

164
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:26,631
Look, I don't want to get
into a whole thing here.

165
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,698
Then give me the muffins.

166
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,785
No, 'cause maybe now
I want the muffins.

167
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,872
You think that because
you're a pseudo-celebrity,

168
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,288
normal rules don't apply to you?

169
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,083
Pseudo? Would you say that
to Eric mccormack?

170
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,210
Look, I've had a rough morning,
so I don't need...

171
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,878
You've had a rough morning?

172
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:45,256
I spent the last ten months...

173
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,092
Hey!

174
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,719
Sorry, wasn't listening. See ya.

175
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,806
You're going to regret this,
bojack horseman.

176
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,099
Oh, really?

177
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,476
I'm gonna regret buying muffins?

178
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,646
What, have they got a lot
of saturated fat in them?

179
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,773
Oh, man, they do have
a lot of saturated fat.

180
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,775
Why'd I buy these?

181
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,532
Man, I really regret
buying those muffins

182
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,867
and then eating them all
on the drive home.

183
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,674
Well, my date
with ayako went really well.

184
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:15,786
Thanks for asking.

185
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,163
I specifically didn't ask,

186
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,748
and I'll thank you to respect

187
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,559
my total lack of interest
in your personal life.

188
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,793
She's hilarious.

189
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,795
I never met a girl
who was so curious

190
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,588
about American bank
routing numbers.

191
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:26,840
Still not interested.

192
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,327
Should we get started
on the book?

193
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,676
What's your hurry?

194
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,237
What do you guys think
I should get ayako

195
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,096
for our 12-hour anniversary?

196
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:36,057
She wants a framed picture
of my mother's maiden name.

197
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,434
Okay, let's get to work.

198
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,605
Let's start at the beginning.

199
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,733
What was your childhood like?

200
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,068
- Normal.
- Normal?

201
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:50,280
Yeah, it was, uh, normal...
Normal childhood stuff.

202
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,449
Here's your omelet.

203
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,825
I'm sorry it's not as good

204
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,744
as the omelets
your secretary makes,

205
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,055
but then you're not married
to your secretary, are you?

206
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,041
Well, maybe if my secretary
also refused to get an abortion,

207
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,207
I would be.

208
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,127
Mommy, can I have an omelet?

209
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,254
You're the birthday boy.

210
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,132
Normal childhood,

211
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,801
and then just get right
into the big, famous part.

212
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,738
Look, if you're not
ready to talk, we can wait.

213
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,221
I am ready to talk.

214
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,949
Why wouldn't I want
to talk about my parents?

215
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,253
They're so normal. That's crazy.

216
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,976
You sound like
a crazy person, not me.

217
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,394
Stop being so crazy, crazy.

218
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,188
Why are you calling me crazy?

219
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:26,107
Okay. Was your father...

220
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,734
Hold on, I got to take this.
Hello?

221
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,741
Hey, bojack, I've got
Princess Carolyn for you.

222
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,321
- It's urgent.
- Great, put her on.

223
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:32,715
Just a sec.
I'll see if she's available.

224
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,365
J“ when you're walking alone j”

225
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,493
j“ because jellicles are
and... j”

226
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,287
bojack, are you
watching msnbsea right now?

227
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:40,705
Great question.

228
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,266
Well, I didn't fall down
on my remote,

229
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,417
randomly changing the channel
to msnbsea

230
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,711
while simultaneously
crippling myself,

231
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:50,340
thus physically forcing me
to watch msnbsea, so no.

232
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:53,009
No, I'm not watching
msnbsea right now.

233
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:54,987
Yeah, well, Hamlet,
you might want to turn it on.

234
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,051
They're talking about you.

235
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,639
Ooh! Good things, I hope.

236
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,562
Our guest via satellite
is Neal mcbeal,

237
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,065
a naval officer on leave
from Afghanistan.

238
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,392
Welcome to the program, Neal.

239
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:09,484
Thank you, Tom.

240
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,319
Hey, I met this guy.

241
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,613
All Neal wanted
when he got home...

242
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,033
And I emphasize,
from Afghanistan...

243
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,829
Was his favorite brand
of breakfast muffins.

244
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,997
When he went to the supermarket
and called dibs

245
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,290
on the last box...

246
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,167
Well, tell us
what happened, Neal.

247
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:30,338
Bojack horseman, from
the '90s sitcom horsin'around,

248
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,382
refused to respect my dibs.

249
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,926
Have you no shame,
bojack horseman?

250
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,928
Seen here sneezing
at a Christmas party.

251
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,513
Oh, not the sneezing pic...

252
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,400
Why do they always use
the sneezing picture?

253
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,433
In the '90s,
we laughed at your antics.

254
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,811
Oh, how we laughed.
"Ha, ha, ha,"

255
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,646
we chortled in rapturous glee.

256
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:50,275
But when you deny the dibs
called by our men and women

257
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,569
on the frontlines, that is
a sick joke, sir.

258
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,238
A sick, sick joke, indeed,

259
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,574
and you'll forgive me
if I chortle no longer,

260
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,410
for, to me, there is
nothing the least bit funny

261
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:04,080
about stealing a meal
from Neal mcbeal, the Navy seal.

262
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,877
Wait, wait, you stole muffins
from a Navy seal?

263
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,461
I didn't know
he was a Navy seal.

264
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,064
I just thought he was
the regular kind of seal.

265
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,007
This is
classic Hollywood elitism.

266
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,094
Bojack horseman thinks that
because he was on TV,

267
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,760
that makes him better
than everybody.

268
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,388
Well, guess what, bojack,
now I'm on TV,

269
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,140
so now I'm better
than everybody!

270
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:24,100
That's right, Neal.

271
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,686
You didn't even have dibs,
you stupid sea cow.

272
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,081
You guys think I should call in
and set the record straight?

273
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,524
Bojack, these people
feed off controversy.

274
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,836
If you dignify the story with a
response, it's just gonna fan...

275
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,320
I'm now receiving word

276
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,281
that we've got bojack himself
on the phone.

277
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:39,657
Sorry, stopped listening.

278
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,304
You were ramping up
to a "yes," right?

279
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,911
Bojack, what you did today

280
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,079
was a slap in the face
of america's heroes.

281
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,541
Will you apologize?

282
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,877
Okay,
enough about america's heroes.

283
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,587
Can we talk about dibs?

284
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,672
Because he didn't
even really have dibs.

285
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,132
If he had legitimate dibs...

286
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,592
Oh, I had dibs on the muffins.

287
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,969
I hid them
in the produce section!

288
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,616
You left them totally out
in the open.

289
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,014
That's hiding?

290
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:04,575
How did you survive
in Afghanistan?

291
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,683
Those are my muffins!

292
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,644
You give me back my muffins!

293
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,163
Hey, guess what,
I can't give them back

294
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:10,480
'cause I ate them all, okay?

295
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,106
Dude.

296
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,150
Hold on, just to be clear,
since this morning,

297
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,152
you ate all the muffins?

298
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,904
Yeah, I ate them all
in one sitting

299
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,281
because I have no self-control
and I hate myself.

300
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,158
Is that what you want to hear?

301
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,677
Neal, was it
a small container of muffins,

302
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,203
like two to four muffins?

303
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,081
No, Tom, there were
a good deal more than that.

304
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,267
Can you remember exactly how
many muffins were in the box?

305
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,085
Yeah, there were exactly 12!

306
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:35,880
I ate 12 muffins,
and I didn't even want one!

307
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:38,132
There's your goddamn news story,

308
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,761
the mystery of my missing
goddamn self-respect!

309
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:47,600
How'd I come off?

310
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:51,396
Well, that went slightly
better than the worst

311
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:56,192
it could have possibly gone,
so hooray?

312
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,155
It's not even about the muffins.

313
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,199
Everyone is just out to get me

314
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,076
because I'm famous
and so well-adjusted.

315
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:06,828
Well, at least
you've got some privacy.

316
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:09,414
My boyfriend's filming
a reality show at our house.

317
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,420
If I want to be alone,
I have to go to the roof

318
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,519
because it's the only place they
don't have insurance to film.

319
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:14,627
You go on the roof?

320
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,629
Yeah,
just to get some work done.

321
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,964
Is that really weird?

322
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,716
No, it's adorable.

323
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,884
When I was a kid,
I used to climb onto the roof

324
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,928
with my dad
and look at the stars.

325
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,095
What about you?

326
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,889
Were you close with your father?

327
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,183
Happy father's day, daddy.

328
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,950
What is this supposed to be,
a iima bean?

329
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:32,437
It's a heart.

330
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,148
That's some shoddy
craftsmanship, son.

331
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,233
- I tried my best.
- No, you didn't.

332
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,003
You slacked off
and took the easy way out.

333
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,278
In this world, you can either

334
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,005
do things the easy way
or the right way.

335
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,424
You take a boat
from here to New York,

336
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,175
you gonna go around the horn
like a gentleman

337
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,785
or cut through the Panama canal
like some kind of democrat?

338
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,329
Um, the canal?

339
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:53,041
You go around the horn
the way god intended!

340
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,207
Uneventful.

341
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,336
- What?
- What?

342
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,182
I asked if you were close
with your father,

343
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,214
and you sat here in silence
for five minutes

344
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,508
and then said, "uneventful."

345
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,261
You know what, this is
a really good conversation,

346
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:06,988
and I definitely want
to keep having it,

347
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,933
but I just keep thinking
about the muffins thing,

348
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,933
so maybe we could put a pin
in this

349
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,460
thorough deconstruction
of my past,

350
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,720
so I can put that other thing

351
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,396
to bed before it spirals
out of con...

352
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,065
I had dibs!

353
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,650
- My dibs were on those muffins!
- Your dibs were void!

354
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:23,488
I spent a year in Afghanistan
making america safer,

355
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,615
and this is the thanks I get?

356
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:28,701
Really, you, specifically,
made america safer?

357
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,371
Well, bojack, surely,
even you would agree

358
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,598
that the troops are heroes.

359
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,290
I don't agree to that.

360
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:37,001
Maybe some of the troops are
heroes but not automatically.

361
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,688
I'm sure a lot
of the troops are jerks.

362
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,421
Most people are jerks already,

363
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,566
and it's not like giving
ajerk a gun and telling him

364
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,758
it's okay to kill people

365
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:46,219
suddenly turns that jerk
into a hero.

366
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,305
What?

367
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,435
Did you just say you think
the troops are jerks?

368
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,813
Oh, you took that the bad way,
didn't you?

369
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,168
I'm sure a lot
of the troops are jerks.

370
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:02,235
No, no, no.

371
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,404
- The troops are jerks?
- Oh, god.

372
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,905
Most people are jerks already,

373
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,508
and it's not like giving
a jerk a gun...

374
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,992
Hello?

375
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,804
Princess Carolyn needs
to talk to you immediately.

376
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:12,828
Great, put her on.

377
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,672
She's actually just
getting out of a meeting.

378
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,999
- Can you hold for a sec?
- You called me.

379
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,626
J“ when you're walking alone j”

380
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:21,087
j“ because jellicles are
and jellicles do j“

381
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,134
j“ jellicles would
and jellicles can j“

382
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,468
- bojack.
- Ah!

383
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,178
I'm gonna level with you, honey.

384
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,932
This whole you hating
the troops thing is not great.

385
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,267
I don't hate the troops.

386
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,353
I just hate one specific troop.
I don't even hate him, really.

387
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,856
I just think that
he's wrong about the muffins.

388
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,774
I know, bojack...
Just like always,

389
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,460
you're right,
and everyone else is wrong.

390
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,545
But if you don't
swallow your pride,

391
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,112
this is never gonna let up.

392
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,006
- I know you're stubborn...
- I'm not stubborn.

393
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,675
- I'm proud.
- That's kind of the same thing.

394
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,159
No,
it's an important distinction.

395
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,910
Okay, fine. You're not stubborn.

396
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,204
But I'm about to tell you
something very important,

397
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,623
so I want you
to listen carefully.

398
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,834
I'm getting another call.

399
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,335
I'm gonna have
to put you on hold.

400
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,087
J“ when you're walking alone j“

401
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:06,674
j“ because jellicles are
and jellicles do j“

402
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:11,345
it is now day three
of the great bojack jerk-off...

403
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,555
Really?

404
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,682
That's the name
we came up with for this?

405
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:17,477
Who came up with that?
Was it Randy?

406
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,770
Did Randy come up with that?

407
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,481
Anyway, the former
television actor

408
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,524
who hates our troops
has not left his home

409
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,485
since his controversial remarks
on Monday

410
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,111
about how he hates the troops.

411
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:28,988
Bojack horseman makes me sick.

412
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,532
He voiced his opinion,
even though it was unpopular,

413
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,160
and that's the most cowardly
thing a person can do.

414
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:38,456
After we made love, he covered
himself in sheets like an arab.

415
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:39,957
At this very moment,

416
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,293
congress is voting
on a major education bill

417
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,020
that could completely
restructure the...

418
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,880
Joan, I'm sorry
to interrupt you,

419
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:48,674
but we've got some big news
on the bojack horseman front.

420
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,136
It appears that bojack's Lexus
is coming out of the garage.

421
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,013
This is very big news, indeed.

422
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,724
Any comment on bojack's
controversial remarks this week?

423
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,977
Uh, nope.

424
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,647
So where are we going?

425
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,857
Don't worry, I've got a plan.

426
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,150
Whoa!

427
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:07,902
Jeez.

428
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:12,323
Ayako, hey, I need you to get
me three tickets to Kyoto.

429
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,010
You son of a bitch!

430
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,326
You told me you were

431
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,620
an obscenely rich
American entrepreneur.

432
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,998
You had eighty dollars
in your bank account.

433
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,165
Eighty!

434
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,543
Hey, I meant I was rich

435
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,337
because I have friends
like George Bailey.

436
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,273
Who the shit is George Bailey?

437
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,259
Do you have any idea how much
work went into scamming you?

438
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,677
George Bailey!

439
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:33,843
Hello?

440
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,763
Well, I'm out of ideas.

441
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,891
We can hide out at my place
while we make a plan.

442
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,939
Yeah, great, just get me away
from the cameras.

443
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,359
Do we really need
to be filming this?

444
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:49,944
It's for my reality show.

445
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:51,779
You never know
when gold's gonna strike.

446
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,698
Yeah, gold doesn't strike.

447
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,408
That's why you never know.

448
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,410
Bojack, be nice.

449
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,078
Just pretend they're not there.

450
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,580
Okay. Well, I...

451
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,290
Could you speak up, please?

452
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,250
- I'd like to...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

453
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,418
That's too loud.

454
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,212
I want to fix this
as quickly as possible.

455
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,148
I don't care who was right
about the muffins anymore,

456
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,591
even though I was
definitely right.

457
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,093
I just want my privacy back,
so I can finish writing

458
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,013
my tell-all memoir, so everyone
will pay attention to me again.

459
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,015
I've already reached out
to the mcbeal camp.

460
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:22,310
He's willing to publicly forgive
you if you publicly apologize

461
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,937
and present to him
a box of muffins as a symbol

462
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,440
of your great admiration
for the American military

463
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:28,607
and everything they do.

464
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:29,984
But I ate the muffins.

465
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,231
I know. We got another box.

466
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,570
It's in the cupboard.

467
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,417
Oh, you were saving those?
I ate those too.

468
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,324
We've been here for ten minutes!

469
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,200
It's okay,
we'll get more muffins.

470
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,536
I'll get the muffins,
and they're on me.

471
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:43,372
I just found out
I got 80 bucks in the bank.

472
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm helping! Hooray!

473
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,367
So where are we gonna do this?

474
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,003
Do I have to go on msnbsea?

475
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,672
No, we should do it somewhere
people will actually see it.

476
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,383
Oh, why don't you do it
on peanutbutter and jelly?

477
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,011
You can't call a show
peanutbutter and jelly

478
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,387
if there's no jelly.

479
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,097
It's a pun.

480
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,891
It's not a pun
if it only works one way.

481
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,434
Is this a necessary conversation

482
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,227
to be having right now?

483
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,979
Look, I know tempers are high,

484
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,898
but let's not take it out
on the great title

485
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,274
for my reality show,

486
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:13,027
which we all agree
is really clever.

487
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:15,905
We can edit this to make me
look smart, right?

488
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:17,406
J“ yeah j“

489
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,842
- j“ peanutbutter j“
- j“ come on j“

490
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,201
how's this look? Looks good?

491
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,912
- Okay.
- Marker, sound, speed.

492
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,914
Well, here I am, hanging out

493
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,083
with my good friend
bojack horseman,

494
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,834
enjoying each other's company,

495
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,212
as we often do.

496
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,172
Yes, this is all
very authentic and natural.

497
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,384
Oh, someone's at the door!

498
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,511
I will see who it is.

499
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,140
Wow, this is a surprise.

500
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,475
Neal mcbeal.

501
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:46,227
Hello, sir.

502
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:49,563
Thank you for inviting me
into your home. It is lovely.

503
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:54,318
Bojack, is there anything
you'd like to give Neal mcbeal?

504
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:55,528
Ahem.

505
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,738
Oh, yeah, Todd?

506
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:58,989
What the hell is this?

507
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,449
I tried to buy the muffins,

508
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,868
but my bank card got declined
for some reason.

509
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,870
But don't worry,
I still saved the day

510
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,124
because I found this bag
of stale hamburger buns.

511
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,251
I'm sorry?

512
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:12,586
Yeah, they're just giving them
away behind in-n-out.

513
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,880
Why does anybody
pay for anything?

514
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,843
Uh, Neal, as a token
of my admiration,

515
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:23,848
please accept this bag
of stale hamburger buns.

516
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,308
- What?
- Yes, hamburger buns.

517
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,937
It's a symbol
for how we throw our veterans

518
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:32,606
in the trash, sadly,
far too often.

519
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,567
I'm listening.

520
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,402
We send our muffins overseas,

521
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,863
and they come back
as stale hamburger buns,

522
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,824
but that doesn't mean
we should love them any less,

523
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,409
because in their own way,

524
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:47,413
aren't stale hamburger buns
just as good?

525
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,707
Mmm.

526
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:51,083
American made.

527
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,087
So what you're saying is,

528
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,506
you think I'm a hero.

529
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,799
Well, I don't know if I...

530
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:03,763
Say it, bojack. Say I'm a hero.

531
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,264
You're a hero.

532
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:08,851
The troops are all heroes,
every single one.

533
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,728
Great.

534
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:13,355
And I don't believe
saying that cheapens the word

535
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,733
and actually disrespects
those we mean to honor

536
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,944
by turning real people
into political pawns.

537
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,822
Okay, you can let go
of the bag now.

538
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,366
Also, I am not deeply ambivalent

539
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,786
about a seemingly mandated
celebration of our military

540
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,829
by a nation
that claims to value peace

541
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,707
telling our children that
violence is never the answer

542
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:34,877
while refusing to hold our own
government to the same standard.

543
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,588
Yeah, me neither.
I think we're in agreement here.

544
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:40,716
Furthermore, I do not find
it unbelievably appropriate

545
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:43,761
that this conversation is taking
place on reality television,

546
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,346
a genre which thrives on

547
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,348
chopping the complexities
of our era

548
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:50,935
into easily digestible chunks
of empty catchphrases.

549
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,978
Okay.

550
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,814
And finally, I don't...

551
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,651
Hey, look, Mr. Peanutbutter
got a bucket stuck on his head.

552
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:01,779
Guys, guys, where am I?
Can someone tell me where I am?

553
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:04,031
Hey, where'd he get
that bucket from?

554
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:05,825
Who gave him a bucket?

555
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,996
Uh, actually, I had
another point I wanted to make.

556
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,166
Yeah, but who doesn't love
a dog with a bucket on his head?

557
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,376
Come on.

558
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,169
Bucket! Bucket!

559
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,504
Bucket!

560
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:22,591
Bucket! Bucket! Bucket! Bucket!

561
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,969
Hey, can anyone find a handle?

562
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:29,598
Oh, thank you, my friend.

563
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,433
You're a real hero.

564
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,810
Unbelievable.

565
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:34,228
What's your name, young lady?

566
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:36,063
Well, my real name's Angela,

567
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,648
but my friends call me jelly.

568
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:40,609
What?
Oh, my god, did we get that?

569
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,152
Please tell me we got that.

570
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,121
You want
a day-old hamburger bun?

571
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,331
I'm all right.
How'd it go down there?

572
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,750
You know what the problem is
with everybody?

573
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,420
They all just want to hear
what they already believe.

574
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:01,380
No one ever wants
to hear the truth.

575
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:02,882
I want to hear the truth.

576
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,609
I don't know if you want
to tell it, though.

577
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,010
What do you mean?

578
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:09,847
Mr. Normal childhood,
Mr. Uneventful father?

579
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:11,432
Look, I can write you
the standard

580
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:13,517
empty-calorie celebrity
tell-some,

581
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:15,019
if that's what
you're looking for,

582
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,288
but I thought you
might want more than that.

583
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:17,771
I do.

584
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,541
Well, then you're going
to have to open up

585
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:20,983
and give me something real.

586
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,526
What, you think I can't open up?

587
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:23,837
Well, I don't know
if you can or not.

588
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,321
You certainly haven't.

589
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:31,493
Okay, from now on,
full truth, warts and all.

590
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,163
You're not gonna make me look
like an asshole, are you?

591
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,373
I don't know,
are you an asshole?

592
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:41,086
Okay, full truth, here we go.

593
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,755
You want to know
about my parents?

594
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,840
They drank a lot.

595
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:46,675
My father was a failed novelist.

596
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,720
My mother was the heiress to the
sugarman sugar cubes fortune,

597
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,180
and my dad resented her for it.

598
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:52,848
He used to make me cry with him

599
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,642
while listening
to Cole Porter records.

600
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,602
He made me build
my own tree house,

601
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,580
and then he tore it down
while I was at summer camp

602
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,356
because instead of
hearty, Christian nails,

603
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:04,652
I used screws,
which he called fancy Jew nails.

604
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:07,780
Like I said, totally normal.

605
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:14,203
J“ back in the '903 j“

606
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:19,458
j“ I was in a very famous TV show j“

607
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,504
- j“ I'm bojack the horse j“
- j“ bojack j“

608
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:24,922
j“ bojack the horse j“

609
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:28,884
j“ don't act like you don't know j“

610
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:35,140
j“ and I'm trying to hold on to my past j“

611
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,517
j“ it's been so long j“

612
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:39,853
j“ I don't think I'm gonna last j“

613
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,313
j“ I guess I'll just try j“

614
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,649
j“ and make you understand j“

615
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:48,028
j“ that I'm more horse than a man j“

616
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:52,533
j“ or I'm more man than a horse j“

617
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,660
j“ bojack j“

618
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:57,830
boxer versus raptor.
