to be in the produce section.

00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:26,631
Look, I don't want to get
into a whole thing here.

174
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,698
Then give me the muffins.

175
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,785
No, 'cause maybe now
I want the muffins.

176
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,872
You think that because
you're a pseudo-celebrity,

177
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,288
normal rules don't apply to you?

178
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,083
Pseudo? Would you say that
to Eric mccormack?

179
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,210
Look, I've had a rough morning,
so I don't need...

180
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,878
You've had a rough morning?

181
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:45,256
I spent the last ten months...

182
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,092
Hey!

183
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,719
Sorry, wasn't listening. See ya.

184
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,806
You're going to regret this,
bojack horseman.

185
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,099
[Laughing] Oh, really?

186
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,476
I'm gonna regret buying muffins?

187
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,646
What, have they got a lot
of saturated fat in them?

188
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,773
Oh, man, they do have
a lot of saturated fat.

189
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,775
Why'd I buy these?

190
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,532
Man, I really regret
buying those muffins

191
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,867
and then eating them all
on the drive home.

192
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,674
Well, my date
with ayako went really well.

193
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:15,786
Thanks for asking.

194
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,163
I specifically didn't ask,

195
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,748
and I'll thank you to respect

196
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,559
my total lack of interest
in your personal life.

197
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,793
She's hilarious.

198
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,795
I never met a girl
who was so curious

199
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,588
about American bank
routing numbers.

200
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:26,840
Still not interested.

201
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,327
Should we get started
on the book?

202
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,676
What's your hurry?

203
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,237
What do you guys think
I should get ayako

204
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,096
for our 12-hour anniversary?

205
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:36,057
She wants a framed picture
of my mother's maiden name.

206
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,434
Okay, let's get to work.

207
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,605
Let's start at the beginning.

208
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,733
What was your childhood like?

209
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,068
- Normal.
- Normal?

210
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:50,280
Yeah, it was, uh, normal...
Normal childhood stuff.

211
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,449
Here's your omelet.

212
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,825
I'm sorry it's not as good

213
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,744
as the omelets
your secretary makes,

214
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,055
but then you're not married
to your secretary, are you?

215
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,041
Well, maybe if my secretary
also refused to get an abortion,

216
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,207
I would be.

217
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,127
Mommy, can I have an omelet?

218
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,254
You're the birthday boy.

219
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,132
Normal childhood,

220
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,801
and then just get right
into the big, famous part.

221
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,738
Look, if you're not
ready to talk, we can wait.

222
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,221
I am ready to talk.

223
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,949
Why wouldn't I want
to talk about my parents?

224
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,253
They're so normal. That's crazy.

225
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,976
You sound like
a crazy person, not me.

226
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,394
Stop being so crazy, crazy.

227
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,188
[Laughing]
Why are you calling me crazy?

228
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:26,107
Okay. Was your father...
[Upbeat ringtone]

229
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,734
Hold on, I got to take this.
Hello?

230
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,741
Hey, bojack, I've got
Princess Carolyn for you.

231
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,321
- It's urgent.
- Great, put her on.

232
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:32,715
Just a sec.
I'll see if she's available.

233
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,365
J“ when you're walking alone j”

234
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,493
j“ because jellicles are
and... j”

235
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,287
bojack, are you
watching msnbsea right now?

236
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:40,705
Great question.

237
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,266
Well, I didn't fall down
on my remote,

238
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,417
randomly changing the channel
to msnbsea

239
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,711
while simultaneously
crippling myself,

240
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:50,340
thus physically forcing me
to watch msnbsea, so no.

241
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:53,009
No, I'm not watching
msnbsea right now.

242
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:54,987
Yeah, well, Hamlet,
you might want to turn it on.

243
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,051
They're talking about you.

244
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,639
Ooh! Good things, I hope.

245
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:00,141
[Sighs]

246
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,562
Our guest via satellite
is Neal mcbeal,

247
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,065
a naval officer on leave
from Afghanistan.

248
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,392
Welcome to the program, Neal.

249
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:09,484
Thank you, Tom.

250
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,319
Hey, I met this guy.

251
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,613
All Neal wanted
when he got home...

252
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,033
And I emphasize,
from Afghanistan...

253
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,829
Was his favorite brand
of breakfast muffins.

254
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,997
When he went to the supermarket
and called dibs

255
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,290
on the last box...

256
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,167
Well, tell us
what happened, Neal.

257
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:30,338
Bojack horseman, from
the '90s sitcom horsin'around,

258
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,382
refused to respect my dibs.

259
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,926
Have you no shame,
bojack horseman?

260
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,928
Seen here sneezing
at a Christmas party.

261
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,513
Oh, not the sneezing pic...

262
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,400
Why do they always use
the sneezing picture?

263
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,433
In the '90s,
we laughed at your antics.

264
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,811
Oh, how we laughed.
"Ha, ha, ha,"

265
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,646
we chortled in rapturous glee.

266
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:50,275
But when you deny the dibs
called by our men and women

267
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,569
on the frontlines, that is
a sick joke, sir.

268
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,238
A sick, sick joke, indeed,

269
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,574
and you'll forgive me
if I chortle no longer,

270
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,410
for, to me, there is
nothing the least bit funny

271
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:04,080
about stealing a meal
from Neal mcbeal, the Navy seal.

272
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:05,623
[Grunting]

273
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,877
Wait, wait, you stole muffins
from a Navy seal?

274
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,461
I didn't know
he was a Navy seal.

275
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,064
I just thought he was
the regular kind of seal.

276
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,007
This is
classic Hollywood elitism.

277
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,094
Bojack horseman thinks that
because he was on TV,

278
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,760
that makes him better
than everybody.

279
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,388
Well, guess what, bojack,
now I'm on TV,

280
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,140
so now I'm better
than everybody!

281
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:24,100
That's right, Neal.

282
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,686
You didn't even have dibs,
you stupid sea cow.

283
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,081
You guys think I should call in
and set the record straight?

284
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,524
Bojack, these people
feed off controversy.

285
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,836
If you dignify the story with a
response, it's just gonna fan...

286
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,320
I'm now receiving word

287
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,281
that we've got bojack himself
on the phone.

288
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:39,657
Sorry, stopped listening.

289
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,304
You were ramping up
to a "yes," right?

290
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,911
Bojack, what you did today

291
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,079
was a slap in the face
of america's heroes.

292
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,541
Will you apologize?

293
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,877
Okay,
enough about america's heroes.

294
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,587
Can we talk about dibs?

295
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,672
Because he didn't
even really have dibs.

296
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,132
If he had legitimate dibs...

297
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,592
Oh, I had dibs on the muffins.

298
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,969
I hid them
in the produce section!

299
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,616
You left them totally out
in the open.

300
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,014
That's hiding?

301
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:04,575
[Yelling] How did you survive
in Afghanistan?

302
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,683
Those are my muffins!

303
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,644
You give me back my muffins!
[Barks]

304
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,163
Hey, guess what,
I can't give them back

305
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:10,480
'cause I ate them all, okay?

306
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,106
Dude.

307
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,150
Hold on, just to be clear,
since this morning,

308
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,152
you ate all the muffins?

309
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,904
Yeah, I ate them all
in one sitting

310
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,281
because I have no self-control
and I hate myself.

311
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,158
Is that what you want to hear?

312
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,677
Neal, was it
a small container of muffins,

313
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,203
like two to four muffins?

314
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,081
No, Tom, there were
a good deal more than that.

315
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,267
Can you remember exactly how
many muffins were in the box?

316
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,085
Yeah, there were exactly 12!

317
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:35,880
I ate 12 muffins,
and I didn't even want one!

318
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:38,132
There's your goddamn news story,

319
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,761
the mystery of my missing
goddamn self-respect!

320
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:45,807
[Pants]

321
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:47,600
How'd I come off?

322
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:51,396
Well, that went slightly
better than the worst

323
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:56,192
it could have possibly gone,
so hooray?

324
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,155
It's not even about the muffins.

325
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,199
Everyone is just out to get me

326
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,076
because I'm famous
and so well-adjusted.

327
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:06,828
Well, at least
you've got some privacy.

328
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:09,414
My boyfriend's filming
a reality show at our house.

329
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,420
If I want to be alone,
I have to go to the roof

330
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,519
because it's the only place they
don't have insurance to film.

331
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:14,627
You go on the roof?

332
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,629
Yeah,
just to get some work done.

333
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,964
Is that really weird?

334
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,716
No, it's adorable.

335
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,884
When I was a kid,
I used to climb onto the roof

336
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,928
with my dad
and look at the stars.

337
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,095
What about you?

338
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,889
Were you close with your father?

339
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,183
Happy father's day, daddy.

340
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,950
What is this supposed to be,
a iima bean?

341
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:32,437
It's a heart.

342
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,148
That's some shoddy
craftsmanship, son.

343
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,233
- I tried my best.
- No, you didn't.

344
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,003
You slacked off
and took the easy way out.

345
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,278
In this world, you can either

346
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,005
do things the easy way
or the right way.

347
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,424
You take a boat
from here to New York,

348
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,175
you gonna go around the horn
like a gentleman

349
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,785
or cut through the Panama canal
like some kind of democrat?

350
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,329
Um, the canal?

351
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:53,041
You go around the horn
the way god intended!

352
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,207
Uneventful.

353
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,336
- What?
- What?

354
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,182
I asked if you were close
with your father,

355
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,214
and you sat here in silence
for five minutes

356
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,508
and then said, "uneventful."

357
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,261
You know what, this is
a really good conversation,

358
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:06,988
and I definitely want
to keep having it,

359
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,933
but I just keep thinking
about the muffins thing,

360
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,933
so maybe we could put a pin
in this

361
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,460
thorough deconstruction
of my past,

362
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,720
so I can put that other thing

363
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,396
to bed before it spirals
out of con...

364
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,065
I had dibs!

365
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,650
- My dibs were on those muffins!
- Your dibs were void!

366
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:23,488
I spent a year in Afghanistan
making america safer,

367
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,615
and this is the thanks I get?

368
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:28,701
Really, you, specifically,
made america safer?

369
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,371
Well, bojack, surely,
even you would agree

370
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,598
that the troops are heroes.

371
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,290
I don't agree to that.

372
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:37,001
Maybe some of the troops are
heroes but not automatically.

373
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,688
I'm sure a lot
of the troops are jerks.

374
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,421
Most people are jerks already,

375
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,566
and it's not like giving
ajerk a gun and telling him

376
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,758
it's okay to kill people

377
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:46,219
suddenly turns that jerk
into a hero.

378
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,305
What?

379
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,435
Did you just say you think
the troops are jerks?

380
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,813
Oh, you took that the bad way,
didn't you?

381
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,168
I'm sure a lot
of the troops are jerks.

382
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:02,235
No, no, no.

383
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,404
- The troops are jerks?
- Oh, god.

384
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,905
Most people are jerks already,

385
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,508
and it's not like giving
a jerk a gun...

386
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,992
[Upbeat ringtone] Hello?

387
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,804
Princess Carolyn needs
to talk to you immediately.

388
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:12,828
Great, put her on.

389
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,672
She's actually just
getting out of a meeting.

390
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,999
- Can you hold for a sec?
- You called me.

391
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,626
J“ when you're walking alone j”

392
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:21,087
j“ because jellicles are
and jellicles do j“

393
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,134
j“ jellicles would
and jellicles can j“

394
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,468
- bojack.
- Ah!

395
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,178
I'm gonna level with you, honey.

396
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,932
This whole you hating
the troops thing is not great.

397
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,267
I don't hate the troops.

398
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,353
I just hate one specific troop.
I don't even hate him, really.

399
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,856
I just think that
he's wrong about the muffins.

400
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,774
I know, bojack...
Just like always,

401
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,460
you're right,
and everyone else is wrong.

402
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,545
But if you don't
swallow your pride,

403
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,112
this is never gonna let up.

404
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,006
- I know you're stubborn...
- I'm not stubborn.

405
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,675
- I'm proud.
- That's kind of the same thing.

406
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,159
No,
it's an important distinction.

407
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,910
Okay, fine. You're not stubborn.

408
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,204
But I'm about to tell you
something very important,

409
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,623
so I want you
to listen carefully.

410
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,834
I'm getting another call.

411
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,335
I'm gonna have
to put you on hold.

412
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,087
J“ when you're walking alone j“

413
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:06,674
j“ because jellicles are
and jellicles do j“

414
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:11,345
it is now day three
of the great bojack jerk-off...

415
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,555
Really?

416
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,682
That's the name
we came up with for this?

417
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:17,477
Who came up with that?
Was it Randy?

418
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,770
Did Randy come up with that?

419
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,481
Anyway, the former
television actor

420
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,524
who hates our troops
has not left his home

421
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,485
since his controversial remarks
on Monday

422
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,111
about how he hates the troops.

423
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:28,988
Bojack horseman makes me sick.

424
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,532
He voiced his opinion,
even though it was unpopular,

425
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,160
and that's the most cowardly
thing a person can do.

426
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:38,456
After we made love, he covered
himself in sheets like an arab.

427
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:39,957
At this very moment,

428
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,293
congress is voting
on a major education bill

429
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,020
that could completely
restructure the...

430
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,880
Joan, I'm sorry
to interrupt you,

431
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:48,674
but we've got some big news
on the bojack horseman front.

432
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,136
It appears that bojack's Lexus
is coming out of the garage.

433
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,013
This is very big news, indeed.

434
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,724
Any comment on bojack's
controversial remarks this week?

435
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,977
Uh, nope. [Tires screech]

436
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,647
So where are we going?

437
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,857
Don't worry, I've got a plan.

438
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,150
[Tires screech] Whoa!

439
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:07,902
Jeez.

440
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:12,323
Ayako, hey, I need you to get
me three tickets to Kyoto.

441
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,010
[Speaking Japanese]
You son of a bitch!

442
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,326
You told me you were

443
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,620
an obscenely rich
American entrepreneur.

444
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,998
You had eighty dollars
in your bank account.

445
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,165
Eighty!

446
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,543
Hey, I meant I was rich

447
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,337
because I have friends
like George Bailey.

448
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,273
[Speaking Japanese]
Who the shit is George Bailey?

449
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,259
Do you have any idea how much
work went into scamming you?

450
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,677
George Bailey!

451
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:33,843
Hello?

452
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,763
Well, I'm out of ideas.

453
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,891
We can hide out at my place
while we make a plan.

454
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,939
Yeah, great, just get me away
from the cameras.

455
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,359
Do we really need
to be filming this?

456
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:49,944
It's for my reality show.

457
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:51,779
You never know
when gold's gonna strike.

458
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,698
Yeah, gold doesn't strike.

459
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,408
That's why you never know.

460
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,410
Bojack, be nice.

461
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,078
Just pretend they're not there.

462
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,580
Okay. Well, I...

463
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,290
Could you speak up, please?

464
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,250
- I'd like to...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

465
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,418
That's too loud.

466
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,212
I want to fix this
as quickly as possible.

467
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,148
I don't care who was right
about the muffins anymore,

468
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,591
even though I was
definitely right.

469
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,093
I just want my privacy back,
so I can finish writing

470
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,013
my tell-all memoir, so everyone
will pay attention to me again.

471
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,015
I've already reached out
to the mcbeal camp.

472
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:22,310
He's willing to publicly forgive
you if you publicly apologize

473
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,937
and present to him
a box of muffins as a symbol

474
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,440
of your great admiration
for the American military

475
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:28,607
and everything they do.

476
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:29,984
But I ate the muffins.

477
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,231
I know. We got another box.

478
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,570
It's in the cupboard.

479
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,417
Oh, you were saving those?
I ate those too.

We've been here for ten minutes!

481
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,200
It's okay,
we'll get more muffins.

482
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,536
I'll get the muffins,
and they're on me.

483
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:43,372
I just found out
I got 80 bucks in the bank.

484
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm helping! Hooray!

485
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,367
So where are we gonna do this?

486
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,003
Do I have to go on msnbsea?

487
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,672
No, we should do it somewhere
people will actually see it.

488
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,383
Oh, why don't you do it
on peanutbutter and jelly?

489
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,011
You can't call a show
peanutbutter and jelly

490
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,387
if there's no jelly.

491
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,097
It's a pun.

492
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,891
It's not a pun
if it only works one way.

493
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,434
Is this a necessary conversation

494
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,227
to be having right now?

495
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,979
Look, I know tempers are high,

496
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,898
but let's not take it out
on the great title

497
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,274
for my reality show,

498
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:13,027
which we all agree
is really clever.

499
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:15,905
We can edit this to make me
look smart, right?

00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:17,406
J“ yeah j“

501
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,842
- j“ peanutbutter j“
- j“ come on j“

00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,201
how's this look? Looks good?

00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,912
- Okay.

enjoying each other's company,

507
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,212
as we often do.

508
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,172
Yes, this is all
very authentic and natural.

[Doorbell rings]

510
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,384
Oh, someone's at the door!

511
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,511
I will see who it is.

512
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,140
Wow, this is a surprise.

513
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,475
Neal mcbeal.

514
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:46,227
Hello, sir.

515
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:49,563
Thank you for inviting me
into your home. It is lovely.

516
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:54,318
Bojack, is there anything
you'd like to give Neal mcbeal?

517
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:55,528
Ahem.

518
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,738
Oh, yeah, Todd?

519
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:58,989
What the hell is this?

520
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,449
I tried to buy the muffins,

521
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,868
but my bank card got declined
for some reason.

522
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,870
But don't worry,
I still saved the day

523
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,124
because I found this bag
of stale hamburger buns.

524
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,251
I'm sorry?

525
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:12,586
Yeah, they're just giving them
away behind in-n-out.

526
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,880
Why does anybody
pay for anything?

527
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,843
Uh, Neal, as a token
of my admiration,

528
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:23,848
please accept this bag
of stale hamburger buns.

529
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,308
- What?
- Yes, hamburger buns.

530
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,937
It's a symbol
for how we throw our veterans

531
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:32,606
in the trash, sadly,
far too often.

532
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,567
I'm listening.

533
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,402
We send our muffins overseas,

534
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,863
and they come back
as stale hamburger buns,

535
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,824
but that doesn't mean
we should love them any less,

536
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,409
because in their own way,

537
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:47,413
aren't stale hamburger buns
just as good?

538
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,707
Mmm.

539
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:51,083
American made.

540
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,087
So what you're saying is,

541
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,506
you think I'm a hero.

542
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,799
Well, I don't know if I...

543
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:03,763
Say it, bojack. Say I'm a hero.

544
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,264
You're a hero.

545
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:08,851
The troops are all heroes,
every single one.

546
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,728
Great.

547
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:13,355
And I don't believe
saying that cheapens the word

548
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,733
and actually disrespects
those we mean to honor

549
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,944
by turning real people
into political pawns.

550
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,822
Okay, you can let go
of the bag now.

551
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,366
Also, I am not deeply ambivalent

552
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,786
about a seemingly mandated
celebration of our military

553
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,829
by a nation
that claims to value peace

554
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,707
telling our children that
violence is never the answer

555
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:34,877
while refusing to hold our own
government to the same standard.

556
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,588
Yeah, me neither.
I think we're in agreement here.

557
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:40,716
Furthermore, I do not find
it unbelievably appropriate

558
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:43,761
that this conversation is taking
place on reality television,

559
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,346
a genre which thrives on

560
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,348
chopping the complexities
of our era

561
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:50,935
into easily digestible chunks
of empty catchphrases.

562
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,978
Okay.

563
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,814
And finally, I don't...

564
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,651
Hey, look, Mr. Peanutbutter
got a bucket stuck on his head.

565
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:01,779
Guys, guys, where am I?
Can someone tell me where I am?

566
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:04,031
Hey, where'd he get
that bucket from?

567
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:05,825
Who gave him a bucket?

568
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,202
[Laughter]

569
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,996
Uh, actually, I had
another point I wanted to make.

570
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,166
Yeah, but who doesn't love
a dog with a bucket on his head?

571
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,376
Come on.

572
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,169
Bucket! Bucket!

573
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,504
[Crowd] Bucket!

574
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:22,591
Bucket! Bucket! Bucket! Bucket!

575
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,969
Hey, can anyone find a handle?

576
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,929
[Howls] [All cheer]

577
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:29,598
Oh, thank you, my friend.

578
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,433
You're a real hero.

579
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,810
Unbelievable.

580
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:34,228
What's your name, young lady?

581
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:36,063
Well, my real name's Angela,

582
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,648
but my friends call me jelly.

583
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:40,609
What?
Oh, my god, did we get that?

584
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,152
Please tell me we got that.

585
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,619
[Chuffs]

586
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,121
You want
a day-old hamburger bun?

587
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,331
I'm all right.
How'd it go down there?

588
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,750
You know what the problem is
with everybody?

589
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,420
They all just want to hear
what they already believe.

590
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:01,380
No one ever wants
to hear the truth.

591
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:02,882
I want to hear the truth.

592
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,609
I don't know if you want
to tell it, though.

593
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,010
What do you mean?

594
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:09,847
Mr. Normal childhood,
Mr. Uneventful father?

595
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:11,432
Look, I can write you
the standard

596
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:13,517
empty-calorie celebrity
tell-some,

597
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:15,019
if that's what
you're looking for,

598
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,288
but I thought you
might want more than that.

599
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:17,771
I do.

600
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,541
Well, then you're going
to have to open up

601
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:20,983
and give me something real.

602
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,526
What, you think I can't open up?

603
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:23,837
Well, I don't know
if you can or not.

604
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,321
You certainly haven't.

605
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,989
[Sighs]

606
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:31,493
Okay, from now on,
full truth, warts and all.

607
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,163
You're not gonna make me look
like an asshole, are you?

608
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,373
I don't know,
are you an asshole?

609
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:41,086
Okay, full truth, here we go.

610
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,755
You want to know
about my parents?

611
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,840
They drank a lot.

612
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:46,675
My father was a failed novelist.

613
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,720
My mother was the heiress to the
sugarman sugar cubes fortune,

614
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,180
and my dad resented her for it.

615
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:52,848
He used to make me cry with him

616
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,642
while listening
to Cole Porter records.

617
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,602
He made me build
my own tree house,

618
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,580
and then he tore it down
while I was at summer camp

619
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,356
because instead of
hearty, Christian nails,

620
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:04,652
I used screws,
which he called fancy Jew nails.

621
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:07,780
Like I said, totally normal.

622
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:14,203
J“ back in the '903 j“

623
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:19,458
j“ I was in a very famous TV show j“

624
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,504
- j“ I'm bojack the horse j“
- j“ bojack j“

625
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:24,922
j“ bojack the horse j“

626
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:28,884
j“ don't act like you don't know j“

627
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:35,140
j“ and I'm trying to hold on to my past j“

628
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,517
j“ it's been so long j“

629
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:39,853
j“ I don't think I'm gonna last j“

630
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,313
j“ I guess I'll just try j“

631
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,649
j“ and make you understand j“

632
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:48,028
j“ that I'm more horse than a man j“

633
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:52,533
j“ or I'm more man than a horse j“

634
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,660
j“ bojack j“

635
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:57,830
boxer versus raptor.
