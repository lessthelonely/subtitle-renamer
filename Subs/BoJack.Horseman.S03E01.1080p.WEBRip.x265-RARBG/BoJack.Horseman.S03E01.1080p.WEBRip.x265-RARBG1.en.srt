1
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,300
<i>It's a dream come true.</i>

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,054
<i>You've been trying to get</i>
<i>this movie made for 20 years.</i>

3
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:15,891
<i>Did you ever think you'd be sitting here,</i>
<i>talking about</i> Secretariat?

4
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,935
Sitting here? In this hotel room?

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,356
It's a dream come true.

6
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,358
What's it like to play Secretariat?

7
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:25,442
Dream come true.

8
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,195
Playing Secretariat, what was that like?

9
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,238
Dream come true.

10
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:31,281
<i>How long you in New York for?</i>

11
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,116
Just a couple days of fun interviews,

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,494
then it's off to Chicago
for more fun interviews,

13
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:38,997
and then, if I don't blow my brains out,
I get to go back to L.A.

14
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:41,917
Darling, you're doing marvelously,
I am so proud of you.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,002
If I could make one slight adjustment?

16
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:45,963
Maybe fewer jokes
about how these interviews

17
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,173
- make you want to blow your brains out?
- Right. Sorry.

18
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:51,343
I am so thrilled to be here,
talking with, uh...

19
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,595
-Yahoo Finland.
-Yahoo Finland.

20
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,598
- Are you Finnish?
- No, we are just getting started.

21
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:57,891
Walked right into that one.

22
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:02,354
What would an Oscar nomination
mean for Mr. BoJack Horseman?

23
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,439
Any award recognition is just gravy.

24
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:06,775
The real joy is to sit
in this hotel room all day,

25
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,860
answering the same questions
over and over again.

26
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:11,530
Great answers, you're divine.
I'm in love with you.

27
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:14,658
One small adjustment.
I don't think sarcasm is going to read.

28
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,536
Just write a script for me,
so I don't have to think for myself.

29
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,788
Honey, I would shove my hand
up your ass

30
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,791
and control your mouth like a Muppet
if it would win you an Oscar.

31
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:23,750
What do I know?

32
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:26,795
I'm just the publicist you hired
to help win you an Oscar.

33
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:29,339
<i>What's it like to play Seabiscuit?</i>

34
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,466
I don't know.
You'd have to ask Tobey Maguire.

35
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,094
Your last attempt at a comeback
was <i>The BoJack Horseman Show.</i>

36
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,137
Pass.

37
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,598
People still see you as the guy
from that sucky show from the '90s.

38
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,475
<i>Horsin' Around </i>was not a sucky show.

39
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:43,854
- Yeah, but it was.
- It lasted nine seasons.

40
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,814
Its whole purpose
was for people to watch it

41
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,357
so the network could sell ad time,

42
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,610
so the show could make more money
than it cost to produce.

43
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,737
It did that well. It was a good show.

44
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,615
- Yes, but it sucked.
- It didn't suck!

45
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,201
Great job today.
It could not have gone better.

46
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:01,538
My only note would be
stop defending <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

47
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,123
Why? Millions of people loved it!

48
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:06,668
We need to use these next few months
to define your story.

49
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:10,255
When people see you
they need to think Oscar winner,

50
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:13,258
not dumb asshole from an old TV show
that nobody cares about.

51
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:14,718
Okay, I hear what you're saying,

52
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,346
but we can both agree <i>Horsin' Around</i>
was a good show, right?

53
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,222
BoJack, you know
I think the world of you.

54
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:23,060
I think you are so smart and attractive,
so I'm not going to mince words.

55
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,438
<i>Horsin' Around </i>was a piece of shit.

56
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:35,322
<i>♪ ♪ </i>

57
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:26,373
Looking good. Fantastic.
You need a coaster.

58
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,917
I told you to wear lipstick
and underpants, Teresa.

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,877
I put everything bill-related
in one folder.

60
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:33,422
Gas bill, cable bill,
and the new headshots for Billy Zane.

61
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,549
- Thank you, Judah.
- You also wanted me to remind you

62
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:36,967
- to call Mr. Peanutbutter.
- Yeah.

63
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,094
Ping me again in two minutes?
No, five minutes.

64
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,971
Uh, when's our call
with BoJack and Spanakopita?

65
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,807
The one that started seven minutes ago?
It started seven minutes ago.

66
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:44,725
What?

67
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:47,310
Diane's in your office right now,
stalling... poorly.

68
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,939
And that is my opinion on the Octomom.

69
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,524
Remember Octomom?

70
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:55,277
<i>Diane, are you stalling</i>
<i>for Princess Carolyn?</i>

71
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,612
What? You know who was good at stallin'

72
00:03:57,696 --> 00:04:00,240
was Joseph Stalin.

73
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,868
<i>If anything,</i>
<i>Stalin was ruthlessly efficient.</i>

74
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,369
<i>Get your head out of your ass.</i>

75
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:09,166
He also had a city named after him.
Isn't that right, Princess Carolyn,

76
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,626
- who's been here the whole time?
- Hey, buddy.

77
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,712
How was your first big day
at the press junket?

78
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:17,090
Endless. It was like
the second act of a Judd Apatow movie.

79
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:18,759
He was exquisite.

80
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,886
The movie's tracking really well
on social.

81
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,764
New media impressions are up
23 percent across platforms.

82
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:24,931
What does that mean?

83
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,392
Oh, I have no idea.
I assumed you would know.

84
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,229
But I keep tweeting things
and they keep getting retweeted,

85
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:32,689
so we're doing something right.

86
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,691
Yesterday I dropped my phone
in the bathroom

87
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,110
which made BoJack's Instagram
post a picture of the floor,

88
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,780
with the caption "<i>spujb."</i>
That got 4000 likes.

89
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,490
- <i>Great.</i>
- I am exhausted.

90
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:44,159
Being a movie star is the hardest job.

91
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,661
And we get no recognition.

92
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,121
Okay, you're gonna love this.

93
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:51,958
I pulled some strings at <i>Manatee Fair</i>
and set up an interview tomorrow night.

94
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:54,461
BoJack is not ready
for a magazine feature.

95
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,505
Relax. It's not that big a deal.

96
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:59,341
I didn't realize
you were an authority on deal size.

97
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,342
<i>Listen, Moussaka...</i>

98
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:04,221
Ladies, please.
There's plenty of BoJack to go around.

99
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,182
I can do all the bullshit things
Ana's scheduled for me in the morning

100
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:10,685
and still have time for Princess Carolyn's
bullshit thing tomorrow night.

101
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,270
Now, pajamas.

102
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:13,271
Whaa!

103
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,440
- Todd?!
- <i>What is going on over there?</i>

104
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,484
<i>BoJack smuggled</i>
<i>a young boy into his room.</i>

105
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,070
No big deal.
Movie stars do it all the time.

106
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,780
Where am I?

107
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,657
Bagels? Pizza?

108
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,117
Hipsters? Urine?

109
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:29,371
- Am I in Minneapolis?
- What? No, you're in New York.

110
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,164
Follow-up: why are you in New York?

111
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:34,167
Beats me. Sometimes I just am places.

112
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,837
I can't get to sleep. Oh, God.

113
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,467
Yeah, that'll do it.

114
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:49,724
Is my name Sarah Koenig?
Because I'm about to get cereal.

115
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,562
I am the queen.

116
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,397
Follow me, citizens.

117
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,942
There are no sad times
in our cave of possibilities.

118
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,286
Huh.

119
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:13,164
Small bottle of shampoo?!
Not on my watch!

120
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,752
You better not have gotten
your failure stink

121
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,838
all over my important movie star clothes.

122
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,631
- Ohh...
- I didn't mean that.

123
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,800
You're my friend
and you don't stink of failure.

124
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:27,178
Your stink is one of good intentions
and youthful exuberance.

125
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,014
<i>Hooray, compliment!</i>

126
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,683
You wanted me to ping you
regarding Mr. Peanutbutter.

127
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,519
Oh, fish! Guys, hold on,
I have to make a quick call.

128
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:36,396
- What? You're already on a call.
- <i>Sorry.</i>

129
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,106
- Please hold.
<i>- This is ridiculous.</i>

130
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,859
- Hello?
<i>- It's your agent!</i>

131
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,194
I wanted to remind you
of your meeting with Pinky today.

132
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:44,863
I think I'm already in it.

133
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,743
- Do I need to be on this call still?
- I put you on conference. How do I...?

134
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:53,663
- BoJack Horseman, is that you?!
- Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

135
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:57,375
Hey buddy, loved that bathroom floor pic
you posted yesterday.

136
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,711
<i>Spujb! </i>Classic BoJack.

137
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,297
<i>We should get together sometime</i>
<i>and take a selfie.</i>

138
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:06,551
I'd love to, buddy,
but I'm kinda in New York right now.

139
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:09,429
<i>New York City?!</i>
<i>They make such great salsa.</i>

140
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,098
I'm here too, honey.
Have a great meeting!

141
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,434
Diane?! Wait, you went to New York?

142
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,227
- <i>No. I'm just on--</i>
- Why wouldn't you tell me?

143
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:17,687
How long are you-- I'm not accusing.

144
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:21,983
<i>I just... I feel safer when I know</i>
<i>that I know where you are.</i>

145
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,985
- I affirm your feelings...
<i>- I don't want to--</i>

146
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,528
...your feelings have value,

147
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,073
but I'm not in New York,
I'm just on the conference call.

148
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,158
- Guys, can we...
<i>-  I feel heard.</i>

149
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,869
- <i>I hear that you feel heard.</i>
- What the hell is happening?

150
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:36,122
- Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter, I'm in New York!
- <i>What?!</i>

151
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:39,417
<i>As Carrie from</i>
Sex and the City <i>might say...</i>

152
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:42,796
<i>- I'm Carrie.</i>
<i>- Todd? In the naked city?</i>

153
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,467
<i>That is going to lead</i>
<i>to some wackiness. You mark my words.</i>

154
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,429
Would you guys literally mark my words?
I do want to refer back to this later on.

155
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,390
We're in the middle of a meeting!

156
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,184
G<i>ot to go.</i>
<i>It's always "Rabbit, Run" with this guy.</i>

157
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,268
Right?

158
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:00,939
Oh, yeah. Somebody did their research
on J.D. Salinger.

159
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,023
<i>Rabbit, Run?</i>

160
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,818
- <i>That's Updike, you illiterate.</i>
- What's Updike?

161
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,861
Not much, dyke, what's up with you?

162
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,571
Is "dyke" an okay thing to say now?

163
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,949
<i>Has it been reclaimed?</i>
<i>I honestly can't keep track.</i>

164
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:14,577
- Who are you asking?
<i>- We're hanging up now, goodbye.</i>

165
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:18,123
Wow! BoJack and Todd in the Big Apple.

166
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:22,210
I want to find one of those fortune
telling robots that can make me big!

167
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,673
Hey, champ,
I have a very important job for you.

168
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,591
Why don't you go get us some ice?

169
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,301
You don't need to patronize me.

170
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:34,556
- But, yeah, I can do that important job.
- Don't get lost, buddy!

171
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,682
I'm not gonna get lost.

172
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,393
The city's on a grid, why would I get...

173
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,191
Oh, no.

174
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,777
Hello? Are you still there?

175
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,905
- They may have hung up.
- I have some good news for once.

176
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,658
I just got promoted
to head of programming.

177
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:56,911
I'm no longer a passenger
on the burning wreckage of an industry

178
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:59,164
that is broadcast television.

179
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,499
- I'm a captain!
- What happened to Wanda?

180
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,626
You didn't hear? She got poached.

181
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,754
- Oh, God!
- By another company.

182
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:06,755
Oh, good.

183
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,506
- They shot her.
- Oh, God!

184
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,675
Straight to the top
of the corporate ladder!

185
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,054
- Oh, good.
- She had to move to Detroit.

186
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:17,474
- Oh, God!
- Which I hear is due for a resurgence.

187
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,601
Can we get to the goddamn point, please?

188
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,020
Anyway, the network
is finally breaking even,

189
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,023
thanks to the runaway success
of <i>Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities:</i>

190
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,484
<i>What Do They Know?</i>
<i>Do They Know Things? Let's Find Out!</i>

191
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,737
Not to mention its companion show
<i>Talking Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities:</i>

192
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,322
<i>What Do They Know?</i>
<i>Do They Know Things? Let's Find Out,</i>

193
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,281
<i>With Chris Hardwick.</i>

194
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:36,534
- So as long as you two stick around...
- I'm taking the show off the air.

195
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,495
Wait, what? Why?!

196
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,538
I told the story I wanted to tell.

197
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:43,875
To prolong it for commercial reasons
would be crass and inorganic.

198
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:44,793
Uh...

199
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:48,671
At long last the public knows
what Hollywoo stars and celebrities know

200
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,048
and what they don't know.

201
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,716
Did they know things?

202
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,676
- Well, we found out.
- This is a nightmare.

203
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,137
Why does everything I love fall apart
as soon as I touch it?

204
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,348
Oh, my ex-wife was right about me.

205
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:02,143
I <i>am </i>no Christopher
from the Tesla dealership.

206
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,526
Is this as good as it gets?

207
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:14,781
Or are we living in the ghost town
where once my career did blossom?

208
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,159
Who will speak my name
when I am gone?

209
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:22,747
Who will sing lamentations
for he who once talked soup?

210
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:26,668
What legacy of ruin am I left with?

211
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:30,630
What rewards have I reaped
for the damage done?

212
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,925
I do not miss the spotlight's glare,

213
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:38,096
but I do... a little, miss sunshine.

214
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,687
But before you fold the omelette,

215
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,607
I'd like the chef to hold the pan up
and whisper his or her dreams into it.

216
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:53,069
Whisper dreams into omelette.

217
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,572
Just coffee.
Don't need to talk to it at all. Thanks.

218
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,241
You look different. Older. A lot older.

219
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,202
I'm not saying you look bad,
just much, much, much older.

220
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,245
Thank you, Jill.

221
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,581
You haven't heard from Cuddlywhiskers
recently, have you?

222
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,458
Cuddlywhiskers? I haven't talked
to him since the show was canceled.

223
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:08,793
I worry about him.

224
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:11,296
About six months back, he disappeared,

225
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,589
stopped returning my calls.

226
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:16,593
I'm sure he's fine.
I mean, who returns calls?

227
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,928
Promise me you'll check on him
when you get back to L.A.

228
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,681
Maybe swing by his house?
I think you owe him that much.

229
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,641
Fine. Listen, about the play...

230
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:26,311
<i>The Tragedy of Greg KingLear,</i>
a theatrical immersion by Jill Pill?

231
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,354
- Right.
- That's dead. Over.

232
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,273
A thing that happened
that happens no longer,

233
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,691
- like a whimper in the wind.
- Okay.

234
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:36,779
Theater is by its very nature ephemeral.
We shout into the void, "Hey, you!"

235
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,782
And the void says,
"Stop shouting at me, please!"

236
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:43,536
And we grab the void and we spit
in its face, "Sir, I will not."

237
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,413
Boy, did New York do a number on you.

238
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,583
Let me tell you about my next piece.
It starts with you,

239
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:52,003
BoJack Horseman,
completely naked and covered in milk.

240
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,047
- I'll stop you there.
- It's a symbol for rebirth.

241
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,007
I'm not interested in being rebirthed.

242
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,468
I'm still recovering
from being birthed the first time.

243
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,012
Jill, I'm not the guy who does things
that are challenging,

244
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,097
or edgy, or covered in milk.

245
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:06,768
I'm about to be nominated for an Oscar.
I'm thinking about my legacy now.

246
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:10,146
I want to do things that connect
with people, things that last.

247
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,273
That's the whole point, nothing lasts.

248
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,275
No, I know, but see, years after I die,

249
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:16,694
people will still be able
to see me in <i>Secretariat.</i>

250
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,446
- And then what?
- And then...

251
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:22,200
I'll be remembered.
If I win an Oscar, I'll be remembered.

252
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,244
- And then what?
- Then my life will have meaning.

253
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,413
- I don't know!
- Mm-hmm.

254
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,499
You know what the real tragedy
of <i>Greg KingLear </i>is?

255
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,167
Two hours long without an intermission?

256
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,627
It's that he's a marionette.

257
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,089
And he doesn't even know someone else
is pulling his strings.

258
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,008
Mmm, I don't think the chef
whispered his dreams into this.

259
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,468
This does not taste like dreams.

260
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,557
You told me I would be getting
more attention at a smaller agency,

261
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,601
but if anything, I'm getting less.

262
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:51,145
Is this the best time to be on your phone?

263
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:53,815
I'm sorry.
Let me just send this one email...

264
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,192
What? Why isn't it sending? Judah!

265
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,403
I'm taking my business
to Gekko Rabitowitz.

266
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,862
What? No!

267
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:04,033
J.D. Salinger is too big a star to be
hamstrung by some rinky-dink operation

268
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,952
working out of a two-story warehouse.

269
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,538
I need an agency
with at least nine stories.

270
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,580
Uh...

271
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:13,876
That was a reference to my work,
with which you are clearly not familiar.

272
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,211
- Oh...
- Goodbye.

273
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,672
Hello to you, Rasputin.

274
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,466
- Give my regards to the czar.
- I will relay the message.

275
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,469
Oh, I don't know why
I thought I could do this.

276
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:27,056
I'm drowning, and cats hate drowning.

277
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,809
I believe I can take on
more responsibility around here.

278
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,478
- On a provisional basis, of course.
- Okay.

279
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,732
But we're a small agency
and we need to think like one.

280
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,358
Instead of spreading ourselves thinner,

281
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:40,319
we should focus on better gigs
for the clients we already have.

282
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:43,698
- Oh. Like <i>Jerry Maguire.</i>
<i>- </i>Yes.

283
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,326
- What part of <i>Jerry Maguire</i>?
- The part where Tom Cruise's agent

284
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,455
got him a massive payday
for being in <i>Jerry Maguire.</i>

285
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,583
<i>♪ Who's that dog?</i>
<i>Mister Peanutbutter ♪</i>

286
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,917
Princess Carolyn?!

287
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,754
Listen, kid, tough break about
the <i>Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities</i>

288
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,631
<i>Whatever, Whatever, Whatever,</i>
but what are we gonna do next?

289
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:03,217
I was looking forward
to taking some time off.

290
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:06,179
What?
That is the worst idea I've ever heard.

291
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,014
You're the biggest name in TV right now.

292
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,516
<i>and every network would love to air</i>
<i>your next project.</i>

293
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,019
Why don't you get off your lazy keister

294
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:16,189
and come up with some TV ideas
and make us all billionaires?

295
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,398
Go get us some money.

296
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:20,318
<i>Go get it, boy. You can do it!</i>
<i>Go! Atta boy!</i>

297
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:27,116
Daddy, it's so nice having you home.

298
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,535
These last few months have been amazing.

299
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,038
My blood pressure's down,
my stress is down.

300
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,040
Oh, what the...?

301
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,085
There's my favorite accountant!

302
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,545
Great news! P.B. Livin' is back...

303
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,005
- No! No!
- ...in business!

304
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,049
- No!
- Yes!

305
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,176
-Here we go!
-Oh, God, no, please.

306
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:48,388
It's gonna be great, as it always is,
from my perspective.

307
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,723
Dad, you promised
we were gonna play catch,

308
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,768
and then we'd listen to your favorite
Harry Chapin song together!

309
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,395
You never told me what it was!

310
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,730
Oh, it's <i>Cat's in the Cradle</i>,
but don't listen to it now!

311
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,232
I'm gonna go listen to it.

312
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,526
No! The lyrics are too relevant.
Don't do it.

313
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,945
No!

314
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:11,619
So, what's next for BoJack?

315
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:15,456
What do you mean, "What's next?"
Why does everything have to have a next?

316
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,544
I just mean, after <i>Secretariat's</i> all over,
what are you going to do next?

317
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:23,923
We were told this feature would be
pegged to the release of <i>Secretariat.</i>

318
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:27,427
It is, but we also want to get to know
the real BoJack.

319
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,095
- Do we?
- If you want the real BoJack,

320
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,680
there's a book written about that.

321
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,891
But that was BoJack
before the book came out.

322
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,476
Who's BoJack now?

323
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,812
Who's BoJack now? BoJack is just...

324
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,231
He's a guy who could use a drink,
that's who!

325
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,441
Should we order alcohol?

326
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:44,277
Heather, could we have
a moment of privacy, please?

327
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,363
Sure. I'll just plug my ears
and sing an old sea shanty.

328
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:51,951
<i>♪ Oh, the sea she be a salty lass</i>
<i>With a hi, ho, barrel of rum... ♪</i>

329
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,745
Sweetheart, I don't think
we need to be drinking tonight.

330
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:57,123
Trust me, you do not want me
to do this sober.

331
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,293
You don't need to micromanage
everything, okay? I'm not your puppet.

332
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:04,005
All right.
You clearly have everything under control.

333
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:07,717
<i>♪ Raise the mast and raise your glass</i>
<i>And banish ye dragons ♪</i>

334
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,343
<i>♪ To where they come from! ♪</i>

335
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,554
<i>Garçon, dos </i>whiskey sours, <i>por favor?</i>

336
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,056
Actually, make it <i>tres.</i>
And whatever the lady wants.

337
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,851
- Did mama bear finally leave?
- She's a human, but yes.

338
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,644
Well, when the cat's away...

339
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,730
Again, a human.
I like where you're going with this.

340
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,940
I gotta tell you,
I really loved the movie.

341
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,984
You're definitely going to win an Oscar.

342
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,070
That "You Are Secretariat" scene?
Oh, it made me wet.

343
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,322
It made you wet?!

344
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,532
Yeah. "Wet" is manatee slang.

345
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,910
It refers to a feeling
of comfort and warmth,

346
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,704
because a manatee's
natural habitat is water.

347
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,039
Oh, okay.

348
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,041
- It also made me really horny.
- Uh...

349
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,417
That's narwhal slang.

350
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,169
You know, because they have horns.

351
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,888
<i>When I first came to New York</i>
<i>I was young, full of hope.</i>

352
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,890
<i>But you get lost in this town.</i>

353
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,684
<i>One day you look in the mirror</i>
<i>and think to yourself,</i>

354
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,187
"Who is this sad, broken man?"

355
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,356
Listen, kid, I don't need your life story.

356
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,191
I just came out here to commit suicide.

357
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,610
- No, don't!
- Crap! Forgot I could fly.

358
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,244
The first thing you notice about BoJack
is he's got a nice buzz going.

359
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:19,330
Oh, one final question.
Are you more man than horse?

360
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,082
Or are you more horse than man?

361
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,375
What the hell does that mean?

362
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,169
Take off your city clothes
and let's be animals!

363
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:27,255
I want to get natural!

364
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,634
Okay! A manatee and a horse
making out with each other.

365
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:32,969
Just like in nature.

366
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,847
In the old days sailors thought
manatees were mermaids.

367
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:40,184
Remember that episode of <i>Horsin' Around</i>
where Sabrina wanted to be a mermaid?

368
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,019
I don't want to think about that show.

369
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:43,854
I didn't come back to your hotel room

370
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:47,984
because you're a goofy dad who once got
his dick stuck in a vacuum cleaner.

371
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,611
I'm pretty sure
that never happened on the show.

372
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:53,322
If I'm going to sacrifice
my journalistic integrity,

373
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,617
it's because I'm having sex
with a movie star.

374
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:57,535
And they're off!

375
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,706
- You like that, little horsie?
- Yeah.

376
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:05,418
- But I don't need you to talk.
- I'm a mermaid, baby.

377
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:08,379
- Gonna climb up onto your boat.
- What?

378
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,467
- What happened?
- Sorry, I just... Give me a minute.

379
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:17,263
You want me to touch it,
blow on it, sing it happy birthday?

380
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,723
No, no, just...

381
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,725
Why did you say
that thing about the boat?

382
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,477
I don't know, I was being sexy.
You okay?

383
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,813
Just forget it. You ruined it.

384
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:32,612
You want to talk about it?

385
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:36,657
There's nothing to talk about.
It was a misunderstanding, that's all.

386
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,328
She just walked in
at the worst possible...

387
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:43,080
It-- It wasn't my fault, uh, right?

388
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:45,207
I don't know what you're talking about.

389
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,127
On the boat, there was a girl.

390
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,129
- What?
- In New Mexico.

391
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,506
And she trusted me.

392
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:56,552
I keep asking myself
if her mother didn't walk in,

393
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:57,887
would I have done it?

394
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,556
And part of me is sure
that I-- I couldn't.

395
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:04,101
But another part knows that's a lie.

396
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:07,438
How do you make something right
when you've made it so wrong

397
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,898
you can never go back?

398
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,234
I just think
you have to keep moving forward?

399
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,361
Yeah.

400
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:16,656
All my life that's all I've ever done.
What's it gotten me?

401
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:19,492
Well, hey, look,
you're the star of a movie now.

402
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,285
You're probably gonna win an Oscar.

403
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:23,287
I'm not even in it. That's not me.

404
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:26,874
- What do you mean, that's not you?
- I was digitally replaced.

405
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,543
Special effects. None of it's me.

406
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,046
Wow, that's...

407
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,798
That's quite a story.

408
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,591
I shouldn't even be here.

409
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,301
It's been a long night.

410
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,430
Why don't we go to bed?
In the morning, everything will be okay.

411
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,696
Oh, shit.

412
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:02,410
BoJack?

413
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,620
It's 4:00 am.

414
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,623
No, it's 7:00. I'm in New York.
I'm calling from the future.

415
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:10,876
Is that BoJack Horseman?
What is this, a crossover episode?

416
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,919
What do you want?

417
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:15,923
Let's say, hypothetically,
you had some information about me.

418
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,383
You were gonna write about it,

419
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,052
<i>I wanted to stop you</i>
<i>before you could get it published.</i>

420
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,847
What would be a smart thing
I could do in that situation

421
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,265
that would change your mind?

422
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,058
Are we fighting about the book again?

423
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,269
I don't remember
where we left off last time.

424
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,354
No. Diane, not everything is about you.

425
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,773
<i>For once, I have a problem,</i>
<i>I need your help.</i>

426
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,900
Okay, walk me through it again?

427
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,486
I don't have time!
It's already three hours later here!

428
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,322
Thanks a lot. Once again,
you've been no help whatsoever.

429
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:43,200
Spoiler from the future, you suck.

430
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:46,662
<i>Sorry, you don't suck. I'm just...</i>
<i>very stressed out right now. Bye.</i>

431
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,874
Oh, come on, come on.

432
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,335
I'm aware of the situation
and I'm handling it.

433
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,755
- But I haven't even--
- I'm handling it.

434
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,631
I'll see you at the screening tonight.

435
00:20:57,715 --> 00:20:59,008
- But...
- Don't be late.

436
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,010
- BoJack!
- Huh?

437
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,970
There you are. Stay right there.

438
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,181
You will not <i>believe </i>the night I had.

439
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,309
- This city will eat you alive.
- Did you get the ice?

440
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,562
I'll be right back.

441
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:15,775
I'm lost again!

442
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:18,819
<i>All right, Oxnard.</i>

443
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:21,906
We are looking at
a once in a lifetime opportunity.

444
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,033
Too bad Todd's not here.

445
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,076
He's always the best
at coming up with ideas

446
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,245
that at first might seem terrible...

447
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,581
Right.

448
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,042
If he was here,
he'd probably say something like,

449
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,836
"Hey, you know what's cool?
Spaghetti strainers!"

450
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,129
Go on.

451
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:40,382
And you'd say, "I feel like
I've seen that somewhere before."

452
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,551
Hah! That is so me!

453
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,221
And then he'd say, "What if I told you

454
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,641
that this spaghetti strainer
is also a hat?"

455
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:52,228
A spaghetti strainer that's also a hat?

456
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,021
That is a brilliant idea!

457
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,148
That's a terrible idea.
That's my point!

458
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:57,775
Put that in the maybe pile.

459
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,819
Right now, we need to focus
on TV shows.

460
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,570
I'm sure Todd would suggest,

461
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:05,449
<i>A Spaghetti Strainer</i>
<i>That's Also A Hat: The TV Show.</i>

462
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,868
That's it! Todd, you've done it again.

463
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,578
No! Nobody's done anything.

464
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:13,040
Oxnard, I want you to buy out
the entire spaghetti strainer warehouse.

465
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,292
I mean, every spaghetti strainer they got.

466
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:18,212
I'm putting all my money
in spaghetti strainers for this show.

467
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:21,423
- How is this a show?
- Don't ask me. It's your idea.

468
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,558
I took care of our problem.

469
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,142
What did you do?

470
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:35,771
You don't need to know anything else.
It's been taken care of.

471
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,231
Ana...

472
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,775
There-- There was a moment
back at the hotel where...

473
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,696
I really thought I blew it,
I was scared it was all over, and--

474
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,574
And then after, I was relieved.

475
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,493
I don't know if I should win an Oscar.

476
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:52,413
- I don't know if I want to.
- Stop punishing yourself.

477
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,164
I was in New Mexico.

478
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:58,127
None of that matters.
All that matters now is the story.

479
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,212
We get to decide what our story is.

480
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:03,299
Nobody else gets to tell you
what your story is.

481
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,342
- What is my story?
- I'll tell you.

482
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:09,263
This has been your dream for the last
30 years. You made it happen.

483
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:13,517
An Oscar won't make you happy forever,
it won't solve all your problems.

484
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:17,313
You win that Oscar,
the next day you go back to being you.

485
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,566
But that night is a really good night.

486
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:25,404
I think you deserve a really good night,
and I know how to get you there.

487
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,364
Do you want that?

488
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:29,950
Yes, I do.

489
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:33,329
Go introduce your movie. Tell your story.

490
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,831
Tomorrow we fly to Chicago.

491
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:41,503
<i>Being Secretariat</i>
<i>isn't just about running fast.</i>

492
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:43,714
<i>Secretariat's a state of mind.</i>

493
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:47,676
<i>It's about doing the right thing,</i>
<i>standing up for yourself.</i>

494
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,972
<i>Why, I look around and I see</i>
<i>a whole room full of Secretariats.</i>

495
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:54,308
<i>You are Secretariat.</i>

496
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,518
<i>And you are Secretariat.</i>

497
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:59,313
<i>And you... are Secretariat.</i>

498
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:07,196
BoJack, it's such a beautiful movie
and I think such a textured performance.

499
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,073
When you were on <i>Horsin' Around</i>,

500
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:12,076
could you ever have imagined
that you'd give a performance like this?

501
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,245
Yes. Actually, I imagined it a lot.

502
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:18,248
I always knew I was more
than just a dumb TV actor.

503
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,877
Even if other people
didn't always know that.

504
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,630
Seriously, though...

505
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,216
that TV show...

506
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:29,093
it wasn't me.

507
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:31,637
This movie is me.

508
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:35,057
And I can't tell you how great it feels
to finally be doing

509
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,685
the kind of work that I can be proud of.
