1
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,005
[Bojack] Oh, right.

2
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:07,883
Well, just tell whoever, then.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,134
Haaah! [Tires screech]

4
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:11,220
Ooh!

5
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:13,055
[Honks horn]

6
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:15,432
Asshole! [Tires squeal]

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,935
Anyway, I'm off to Malibu
to see herb kazaz.

8
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,229
He has cancer, which,
as you know, is a whole thing.

9
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,481
Plus, he hates me,
so I could really use

10
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:24,191
some good news
at the end of the day.

11
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,859
Oh, my god.
You're going to see herb?

12
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,903
You must be really... nope.

13
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,405
Don't care. Not interested.
[Phone beeps]

14
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,449
Okay, good talk.

15
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:34,409
Hey.

16
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,235
- You ready for this?
- Listen.

17
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:37,388
I want to make sure
I don't spend

18
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,039
any time alone with herb.

19
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,749
I'm bringing you
along as my buffer.

20
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,000
And your memoirist.

21
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,228
I should meet
your old best friend

22
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:44,461
before he dies of cancer.

23
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:45,628
Fine, I guess.

24
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:46,797
Just don't abandon me.

25
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:48,090
No bathroom breaks.

26
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:49,591
And don't slip out of the room

27
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,803
to text your fiance
a bunch of winky smileys

28
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,389
with hearts next to them...
Gross.

29
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,476
Congratulations on
the whole being engaged thing,

30
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:58,642
- by the way.
- Thanks.

31
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,060
It's just starting to hit me.

32
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,728
I'm getting married.

33
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,564
Thank god I don't
have to die alone.

34
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,773
- No offense.
- None taken.

35
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,400
Till you said, "no offense."

36
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,610
So what's the deal with you
and this guy?

37
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,028
You never talk about him.

38
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:13,448
Well, I kind of, maybe
stabbed him in the back.

39
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:16,076
Yeah, it's a bit of a story.

40
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:21,039
A story of power, betrayal,
and ambitious hairstyles.

41
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,624
The year? 198...

42
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,960
- Movie's over.
- Watch the next one.

43
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:28,714
Aw, I'm tired
of watching movies.

44
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,632
- Do you want to play a game?
- Sure.

45
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,385
I spy with my little eye
someone who needs

46
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:34,720
to shut the hell up.

47
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,805
- Is it me?
- It's always you.

48
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,449
- Now, where was I?
- You were about to tell

49
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,033
a story about you being
a shitty friend,

50
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,185
but then, we got interrupted
by you yelling at Todd.

51
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,438
Oh, yeah. Shut up, Todd.

52
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:47,441

58
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:56,134
why do we need
a kitchen and a bathroom?

59
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,053
Pipes are pipes, people.

60
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,014
Do we really need
a toilet and a sink

61
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,600
and a bathtub and...
Wait, hold on...

62
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:06,228
A whole nother room
with another sink?

63
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:07,622
They're all just holes
to the ocean, lady.

64
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:08,814
I mean, come on.

65
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,315
[Laughs]

66
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:11,817
Bojack, you're late.

67
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,623
Here. I got you a beer.
It's on the house.

68
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,112
Don't tell my boss.

69
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,048
Thanks, Charlotte,
but one beer gets me tipsy.

70
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:18,532
I got to be clear-headed
for my set.

71
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,075
Looks like herb's killing.

72
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:22,452
Yeah, and the suits
from abc are here.

73
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:23,619
[Laughter]

74
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,080
Look. They're nodding.

75
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,873
That's the executive version
of laughing.

76
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,501
Wow. They must be serious
about herb.

77
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,461
That's Angela Diaz.

78
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,380
She's the woman who made
pantsuits a thing.

79
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:34,547
Oh, before I forget.

80
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,007
Herb and I are gonna see

81
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,318
back to the future again
this weekend.

82
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,510
- Want to come?
- I'm in.

83
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,095
That movie was amazing,

84
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:41,902
except for all
the lame time period jokes.

85
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,724
We get it.
The '505 were different.

86
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,559
I'll have a new coke, please.

87
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,270
Listen, you guys don't need
to include me on your dates.

88
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,772
Sometimes, it makes me feel
like a third wheel.

89
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:51,939
Bojack, stop.

90
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,066
Without the third wheel,

91
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,609
how would you ride a tricycle?

92
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,056
Wouldn't that make it a bicycle?

93
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,296
Herb kazaz,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,363

- Hey-hooh!
- Great set, man.

96
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,878
It's like everything
you said was something

97
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,119
that I thought before but never
had the balls to say.

98
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:05,746
Thanks, bj. I set 'em up.

99
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,205
Now, you knock 'em down.

100
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,750
Let's give it up
for bojack horseman.

- Well, thank you, bubbles.

102
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,463
I love L.A. don't you guys?

103
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,965
The prettiest girls in
the world flock to this city,

104
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,592
and they end up
with total knobs.

105
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:19,959
Take this couple, for example.

106
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,219
[Laughter]

107
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,180
Excuse me, miss.
Is that your date?

108
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,723
He's my husband.

109
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,558
That's your husband?
You can do better.

110
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,101
Give me a call after the show.

111
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,062
[Laughter]
I'm just kidding around.

112
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,607
[Whispers]
I'm not kidding around.

116
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,241
That guy tipped me a quarter.

117
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,869
That's barely enough money
to buy three gallons of gas.

118
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,796
- You want a slug?
- No, I got to stay sharp.

119
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,581
I got another audition
this afternoon.

120
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,188
God, I can't wait till
I'm finally up

121
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,710
for real jobs instead
of these dumb commercials.

122
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,630
"Here's the thing about
most long-distance plans."

123
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,507
Ugh. I hate
when people say that.

124
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,717
- "Here's the thing."
- It's so stupid.

125
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,344
Just say the thing.

126
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:04,596
You don't need to introduce
the concept

127
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,681
that there's going
to be a thing.

128
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,408
I don't expect to
be offered secretariat

129
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,101
right away,
but when am I gonna be up

130
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,561
for real roles?

131
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,355
We'll get there, bj.
We both will.

132
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,148
In fact, if I play
my cards right,

133
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,435
I might get there real soon.

134
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,566
Wait.

135
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,778
- Did the guys from abc call?
- Uh-huh.

136
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:21,822
They invited me
to some hotshot event

137
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,740
at lacma this weekend.

138
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:26,201
I'm gonna pitch 'em a TV show
while they're drunk.

139
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,912
An off-the-clock,
non-work related social event?

140
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,914
That's the perfect time
to pitch a TV show.

141
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,123
You're brilliant.

142

Hey, hey, look.

That's Joyce DeWitt, isn't it?

145
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,422
That's Joyce DeWitt.
And that's Angela Diaz.

146
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,383
And that's ubu,
the guy who sits.

147
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,885
- He is a good dog.
- [Ubu barks]

148
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,971
Guys, don't take
your eyes off the prize.

149
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,431
We need to fill Charlotte's bag
with these mini quiches.

150
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,891
This is our breakfast for June.

151
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,418
- Herb kazaz.
- Shit, we're busted.

152
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,287
[Plate shatters]
Pretend you don't speak English.

153
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,188
Buongiorno. Bon jovi.

154
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,440
Salutations.
Crap, that's English.

155
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,669
Hey, you mind if I steal
this superstar for a second?

156
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,528
Okay, yeah.
I'll catch you two later.

157
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:02,797
Stay out of trouble. Oh, ho.

158
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,030
Well, there he goes.

159
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,477
Herb's about to hit
the big time,

160
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:06,992
and I'm just gonna be
a small-fry

161
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,494
doing tiny commercials
and eating mini quiches.

162
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:10,704
You're dead wrong.

163
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,071
You're gonna be a big success.

164
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,707
Herb says that to me
all the time.

165
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,876
- He thinks the world of you.
- He does?

166
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,503
Yeah, I'm not worried about
if you'll become a star.

167
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,298
I'm more worried about how
you'll change when it happens.

168
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:22,757
Like, you think I'll get fat?

169
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,926
No, that's not
what I'm talking about.

170
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,153
So you're saying I definitely

171
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,262
- won't get fat?
- No.

172
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:28,805
Well, make up your mind, lady.

173
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,474
Look over there.

No, bojack,
the show's about a horse,

218

if they want my show,

be bj goddamn horseman.

243

why would I say,
"you'll never get me

in that sweater" in this scene

245
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,204
and then,
in the very next scene,

246
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,748
I'm wearing the sweater?

247
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,458
Did my character suddenly forget

248
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,060
that he didn't want to wear
the sweater?

No, see,
that's actually the joke.

Don't explain the joke to me.

mind about the sweater

00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:34,254
Hey, you know I wouldn't
ask if I didn't need it.

347
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,256
Come on, bojack.

348
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,424
How'd we get so far apart, huh?

349
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,593
[Sighs]

350
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,554
You know what?
You can count on me, herb.

351
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,841
I mean, I wouldn't even be here
if it weren't for you.

352
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,226
I knew it!
I knew you'd come through.

353
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,061
And when this is all over,
we're going

354
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,688
to drive back up
to Griffith park.

355
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,982
I still owe you
that high five, right?

356
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,608
Hey, this is a dumb question,

357
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,655
but do you guys ever,
like, all link up together

358
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,612
and do, like, a party train
or a fun circle?

359
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,257
'Cause I feel like
I'd be doing that all the...

360
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,448
Never mind. Stupid question.

361
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,075
Feel stupid for asking that.

- [Crowd shouting]
- [Barking]

363
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,205
Go right ahead.

364
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,332
And then it goes,
"I like healthy gums

365
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,792
in a major way."

366
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,311
See, that's
what I'm talking about.

367
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,753
That's great.

368
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,856
We just gotta make sure
that we work in the phrase

369
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,176
"toothbrush rap" early,
so they know I'm rapping.

370
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,596
Bojack,
can we chat for a second?

371
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:29,309
Ugh. Here we go.
It's the big one.

372
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,769
I'm not gonna waste
your time with small talk

373
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,938
because you work for me,
and your time is my time.

374
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,648
We're letting herb go.

375
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,415
- You can't do that.
- "I can't do that."

376
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,235
I'm not asking you.
It's nothing personal.

377
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,321
I like herb.
I think he's a good guy.

378
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,947
But this is a business,
and every day

379
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,633
we don't fire him,
we're flushing money

380
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,417
- down the crapper.
- Well, if he goes, I go.

381
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,761
"Well, if he goes, you go."
I wouldn't do that.

382
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,329
Bojack, I think you're a star,

383
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,457
and sometimes being a star
means making tough choices.

384
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,709
You can storm out,
make a big show out of

385
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,085
what a "good" friend you are,

386
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,004
or you could be
the guy who does his job.

387
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,464
- Angela...
- I'll tell you when

388
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,257
it's your turn to talk again.

389
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,384
Look, you're a star,
but this is really just

390
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,678
the beginning of
the bojack horseman story.

391
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,097
You can choose
whatever path you want,

392
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,640
but I'll tell you right now.

393
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,309
You don't win awards
and you don't

394
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,227
get to be on the covers
of magazines

395
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,063
and you don't get
to play the lead role

396
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,899
in the secretariat movie
by being a good friend.

397
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,610
What's that old expression
about how the show must go on?

398
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,446
Oh, right.
It's "don't be an idiot."

399
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,741
So what do you think, bojack?
That's a courtesy question.

400
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:29,369
I already know what you think
because I have conversations

401
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,037
like this one five times a day.

402
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,997
I know who you are, and I know

403
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,224
you've already
made your decision.

404
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,750
But if you want to surprise me,

405
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,210
now's the time to do it.

406
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,045
That's what I thought.

407
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,148
You're doing the right thing,
and I know it's hard.

408
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,174
But if herb's really your
friend, he'll understand.

409
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:45,218
Now, you've got
a show to put on,

410
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,677
so I'll let you get ready.

411
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,055
This was a good conversation.
Productive.

412
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:52,850
If you're lucky,
I'll never talk to you again.

[Ia ugh ter]

425
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,256
So what ended up happening
with secretariat?

426
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,882
Went into turnaround.

427
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,693
I don't totally know
what "turnaround" means,

428
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,512
- but they never made the movie.
- Whoa.

429
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,723
This house is way bigger
than yours.

Herb's done really well
for a guy you clicked over.

- Oh, no. Ah.
- That's enough out of you.

432
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,000
Stay out here
and turn this car around

433
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,815
in case we need to leave
in a hurry.

434

has placed you
in bojack's orbit?

ain't sharp enough,

you're still wearing a mask.

[Both] Oh.

519
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,991
Oh, my god, herb,
you met President Clinton?

520
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,492
Oh, yeah. Many times.

521
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,095
Did you think that
I spent the last 20 years

522
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,871

sorry for myself?

523

but I also started...

00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,462
Oh, wow.

527
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,109

the teen choice awards.

528
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,965
Wait, is that Charlotte?

529
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,292
Yeah, yeah. We kept in touch.

530
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:55,885
You should actually
give her a call.

531
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,720
I'm sure she'd
love to hear from you.

532
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,472

for someone so old.

546

I'm running away from the cops,

547
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,795

truer sense,

548

anything to share?

551

Just how amazing it feels
to finally

00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,595
be honest for once.

553
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,139

this one afternoon.

This... this just doesn't
feel right.

566
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,627
I should have brought
a bottle of wine.

567
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:13,838
That's what adults do.
Bojack, damn it.

568
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,756
Is that what's bothering you,

569
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,651
- that you didn't bring wine?
- You're right.

570

I just would have drunk it
on the way here.

This isn't about wine, bojack.

572

If you have something
you need to say to someone,

573
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,559
you should do it
while you have the chance

574

because before you know it,
it'll be too late.

Is this one of those things
where we're talking

about herb but we're actually
talking about something else?

Uh... not sure you get
what's happening here.

This could be
the last time that you...

No. I'm not gonna
give you closure.

You don't get that.

for the rest of your life.

it's never,

ever going to be okay.

- feel better if we just...
- I'm dying.

I'm not gonna feel better,

602
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:31,290
and I'm not gonna be your prop
so you can feel better.

it was like for me?

would turn on me.

It's not my fault you got fired.

I did fine. I had a good life.

615
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,650
But what I needed then
was a friend,

616
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,819
and you abandoned me.

for that.
