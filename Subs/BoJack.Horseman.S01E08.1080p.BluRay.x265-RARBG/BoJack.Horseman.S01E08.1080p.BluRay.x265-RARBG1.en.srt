1
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,005
Oh, right.

2
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:07,883
Well, just tell whoever, then.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,134
Haaah!

4
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:11,220
Ooh!

5
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:15,432
Asshole!

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,935
Anyway, I'm off to Malibu
to see herb kazaz.

7
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,229
He has cancer, which,
as you know, is a whole thing.

8
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,481
Plus, he hates me,
so I could really use

9
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:24,191
some good news
at the end of the day.

10
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,859
Oh, my god.
You're going to see herb?

11
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,903
You must be really... nope.

12
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,405
Don't care. Not interested.

13
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,449
Okay, good talk.

14
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:34,409
Hey.

15
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,235
- You ready for this?
- Listen.

16
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:37,388
I want to make sure
I don't spend

17
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,039
any time alone with herb.

18
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,749
I'm bringing you
along as my buffer.

19
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,000
And your memoirist.

20
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,228
I should meet
your old best friend

21
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:44,461
before he dies of cancer.

22
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:45,628
Fine, I guess.

23
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:46,797
Just don't abandon me.

24
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:48,090
No bathroom breaks.

25
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:49,591
And don't slip out of the room

26
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,803
to text your fiance
a bunch of winky smileys

27
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,389
with hearts next to them...
Gross.

28
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,476
Congratulations on
the whole being engaged thing,

29
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:58,642
- by the way.
- Thanks.

30
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,060
It's just starting to hit me.

31
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,728
I'm getting married.

32
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,564
Thank god I don't
have to die alone.

33
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,773
- No offense.
- None taken.

34
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,400
Till you said, "no offense."

35
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,610
So what's the deal with you
and this guy?

36
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,028
You never talk about him.

37
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:13,448
Well, I kind of, maybe
stabbed him in the back.

38
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:16,076
Yeah, it's a bit of a story.

39
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:21,039
A story of power, betrayal,
and ambitious hairstyles.

40
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,624
The year? 198...

41
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,960
- Movie's over.
- Watch the next one.

42
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:28,714
Aw, I'm tired
of watching movies.

43
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,632
- Do you want to play a game?
- Sure.

44
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,385
I spy with my little eye
someone who needs

45
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:34,720
to shut the hell up.

46
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,805
- Is it me?
- It's always you.

47
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,449
- Now, where was I?
- You were about to tell

48
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,033
a story about you being
a shitty friend,

49
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,185
but then, we got interrupted
by you yelling at Todd.

50
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,438
Oh, yeah. Shut up, Todd.

51
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:43,080
J“ generic '803 new wave j“

52
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,040
j“ beep, bop, beep, bop,
beep, bop j“

53
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:48,710
j“ this is a song
from the '803 j“

54
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:52,714
j“ the decade which
it currently is j“

55
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:56,134
why do we need
a kitchen and a bathroom?

56
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,053
Pipes are pipes, people.

57
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,014
Do we really need
a toilet and a sink

58
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,600
and a bathtub and...
Wait, hold on...

59
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:06,228
A whole nother room
with another sink?

60
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:07,622
They're all just holes
to the ocean, lady.

61
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:08,814
I mean, come on.

62
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:11,817
Bojack, you're late.

63
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,623
Here. I got you a beer.
It's on the house.

64
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,112
Don't tell my boss.

65
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,048
Thanks, Charlotte,
but one beer gets me tipsy.

66
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:18,532
I got to be clear-headed
for my set.

67
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,075
Looks like herb's killing.

68
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:22,452
Yeah, and the suits
from abc are here.

69
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,080
Look. They're nodding.

70
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,873
That's the executive version
of laughing.

71
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,501
Wow. They must be serious
about herb.

72
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,461
That's Angela Diaz.

73
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,380
She's the woman who made
pantsuits a thing.

74
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:34,547
Oh, before I forget.

75
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,007
Herb and I are gonna see

76
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,318
back to the future again
this weekend.

77
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,510
- Want to come?
- I'm in.

78
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,095
That movie was amazing,

79
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:41,902
except for all
the lame time period jokes.

80
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,724
We get it.
The '505 were different.

81
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,559
I'll have a new coke, please.

82
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,270
Listen, you guys don't need
to include me on your dates.

83
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,772
Sometimes, it makes me feel
like a third wheel.

84
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:51,939
Bojack, stop.

85
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,066
Without the third wheel,

86
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,609
how would you ride a tricycle?

87
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,056
Wouldn't that make it a bicycle?

88
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,391
Herb kazaz,
ladies and gentlemen.

89
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,031
- Hey-hooh!
- Great set, man.

90
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,878
It's like everything
you said was something

91
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,119
that I thought before but never
had the balls to say.

92
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:05,746
Thanks, bj. I set 'em up.

93
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,205
Now, you knock 'em down.

94
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,750
Let's give it up
for bojack horseman.

95
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,419
Well, thank you, bubbles.

96
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,463
I love L.A. don't you guys?

97
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,965
The prettiest girls in
the world flock to this city,

98
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,592
and they end up
with total knobs.

99
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:19,959
Take this couple, for example.

100
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,180
Excuse me, miss.
Is that your date?

101
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,723
He's my husband.

102
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,558
That's your husband?
You can do better.

103
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,101
Give me a call after the show.

104
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,062
I'm just kidding around.

105
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,607
I'm not kidding around.

106
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,863
Maker's Manhattan? 2:00 P.M.?

107
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,406
Notjudging.

108
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,241
That guy tipped me a quarter.

109
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,869
That's barely enough money
to buy three gallons of gas.

110
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,796
- You want a slug?
- No, I got to stay sharp.

111
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,581
I got another audition
this afternoon.

112
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,188
God, I can't wait till
I'm finally up

113
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,710
for real jobs instead
of these dumb commercials.

114
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,630
"Here's the thing about
most long-distance plans."

115
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,507
Ugh. I hate
when people say that.

116
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,717
- "Here's the thing."
- It's so stupid.

117
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,344
Just say the thing.

118
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:04,596
You don't need to introduce
the concept

119
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,681
that there's going
to be a thing.

120
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,408
I don't expect to
be offered secretariat

121
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,101
right away,
but when am I gonna be up

122
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,561
for real roles?

123
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,355
We'll get there, bj.
We both will.

124
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,148
In fact, if I play
my cards right,

125
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,435
I might get there real soon.

126
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,566
Wait.

127
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,778
- Did the guys from abc call?
- Uh-huh.

128
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:21,822
They invited me
to some hotshot event

129
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,740
at lacma this weekend.

130
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:26,201
I'm gonna pitch 'em a TV show
while they're drunk.

131
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,912
An off-the-clock,
non-work related social event?

132
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,914
That's the perfect time
to pitch a TV show.

133
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,123
You're brilliant.

134
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,000
These people are so fancy.

135
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,727
Look, look, look.
Hey, hey, look.

136
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,295
That's Joyce DeWitt, isn't it?

137
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,422
That's Joyce DeWitt.
And that's Angela Diaz.

138
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,383
And that's ubu,
the guy who sits.

139
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,885
He is a good dog.

140
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,971
Guys, don't take
your eyes off the prize.

141
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,431
We need to fill Charlotte's bag
with these mini quiches.

142
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,891
This is our breakfast for June.

143
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,418
- Herb kazaz.
- Shit, we're busted.

144
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,287
Pretend you don't speak English.

145
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,188
Buongiorno. Bon jovi.

146
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,440
Salutations.
Crap, that's English.

147
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,669
Hey, you mind if I steal
this superstar for a second?

148
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,528
Okay, yeah.
I'll catch you two later.

149
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:02,797
Stay out of trouble. Oh, ho.

150
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,030
Well, there he goes.

151
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,477
Herb's about to hit
the big time,

152
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:06,992
and I'm just gonna be
a small-fry

153
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,494
doing tiny commercials
and eating mini quiches.

154
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:10,704
You're dead wrong.

155
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,071
You're gonna be a big success.

156
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,707
Herb says that to me
all the time.

157
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,876
- He thinks the world of you.
- He does?

158
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,503
Yeah, I'm not worried about
if you'll become a star.

159
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,298
I'm more worried about how
you'll change when it happens.

160
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:22,757
Like, you think I'll get fat?

161
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,926
No, that's not
what I'm talking about.

162
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,153
So you're saying I definitely

163
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,262
- won't get fat?
- No.

164
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:28,805
Well, make up your mind, lady.

165
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,474
Look over there.
See those tar pits?

166
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,018
Hollywood's a real pretty town

167
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,604
that's smack on top
of all that black tar.

168
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,123
By the time you realize
you're sinking,

169
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,273
it's too late.

170
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,191
Wait, is this a science lesson?

171
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,068
No, bojack, it's a metaphor.

172
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,280
- Ugh, that's worse.
- Bojack, I'm moving to Maine.

173
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:46,823
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Really?

174
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,992
- Does herb know?
- Yeah.

175
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,703
I don't think I'm the person
herb's looking for.

176
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,788
I'm going to miss you,
Charlotte.

177
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,124
Hey, do you ever wonder
what would have happened

178
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,959
if you'd met me before herb did?

179
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,544
Would you have made
a move on me?

180
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:01,671
- Charlotte...
- I don't think you would have.

181
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:02,881
You know why?

182
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,008
I think you're a coward.

183
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,010
Now go stuff some prosciutto
in your pants

184
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,803
before that Webster kid
takes it all.

185
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,266
I love this town.

186
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,101
Why did you bring me
to Griffith park?

187
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,548
Are we gonna get in
a knife fight

188
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,938
like in rebel without a cause?

189
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,565
- I hate that title.
- He had several causes.

190
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:21,772
I wanted to give you this.

191
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:24,194
Look out at that city.

192
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,737
What do you see?

193
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:26,947
Wow, I didn't realize

194
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,353
there were so many day hookers.

195
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,241
I see a city that you and I

196
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,702
will run someday,
and when we're both famous

197
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,788
and have everything
we've ever wanted,

198
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,540
we'll come back here together
and high-five.

199
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,834
I'm not fully on board
with this new high five thing.

200
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,361
What ever happened
to the low five?

201
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,004
Give me some skin.

202
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,423
Bj, listen.
I got a call from abc today.

203
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,800
They bought my TV pitch.

204
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,093
What? That's amazing.

205
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:51,554
- What's the show?
- It's called horsin'around.

206
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,848
Well, good luck
on your rocket ship

207
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,350
to the top without me.

208
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:56,977
No, bojack,
the show's about a horse,

209
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,437
and I told those suits
if they want my show,

210
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,940
then that horse is gonna
be bj goddamn horseman.

211
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,359
- Oh, my god.
- And they said, "no."

212
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,319
- Oh.
- And I said, "please?"

213
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,570
And they said, "okay."

214
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,531
So, what do you say?

215
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,408
- Want to be my star?
- Seriously?

216
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,284
Of course I do. Of course, herb.

217
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,328
Jesus Christ, thank you.

218
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,997
Mm-hmm... whoa, whoa.

219
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,873
I think you got
the wrong idea here.

220
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,640
- Yeah, no, man. Whoa.
- Herb, I'm not...

221
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,085
Me either.
No, I just... you know,

222
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,879
- I caught up in the moment.
- Yeah, no, I gotcha.

223
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,506
Bj, can you believe it?

224
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,217
We're gonna make
an actual TV show!

225
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,177
One that takes
an unflinching look

226
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:35,098
at the gritty reality
of the American family.

227
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,933
Just kidding. Let's get rich!

228
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,268
Both: Yeah.

229
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,772
J“ generic '903 grunge song j"

230
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,817
j“ everyone in flannel j“

231
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,944
j“ generic '903 grunge song j"

232
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:52,782
j“ something from Seattle I

233
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,492
why would I say,
"you'll never get me

234
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,244
in that sweater" in this scene

235
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,204
and then,
in the very next scene,

236
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,748
I'm wearing the sweater?

237
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,458
Did my character suddenly forget

238
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,060
that he didn't want to wear
the sweater?

239
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,404
No, see,
that's actually the joke.

240
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:05,754
Don't explain the joke to me.

241
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,356
I just don't understand
how it's a joke.

242
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,549
So you do want me
to explain it to you?

243
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,134
I want you to add
a scene showing

244
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,821
how I changed my
mind about the sweater

245
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,387
so the goddamn episode
makes sense.

246
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,264
Look at me,
doing your job for you.

247
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:17,807
Way to go, Shakespeare.

248
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,809
Bj, you're doing
the scene as written.

249
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,895
What happened
to the stories I requested?

250
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,314
Where's my rap?
You said you'd write me a rap.

251
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:25,899
We're working on it.

252
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,068
We just need a rhyme for
"and I'm here to say."

253
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,794
Well, what about giving me
rollerblades?

254
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,714
How are people gonna know
that my character is hip

255
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,448
if he doesn't roll the blade?

256
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:35,116
Just get out there
and do your job.

257
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,660
Every one of your ideas
is stupid or racist.

258
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,162
That was one pitch,

259
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:40,514
and I didn't say
they're all thieves.

260
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,082
But if you're too scared
to start

261
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,143
a national dialogue,
maybe I'll take my ideas home.

262
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,461
Good luck making horsin'around
without the horse.

263
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,213
Bojack, hon.

264
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,465
That audience out there
traveled from all over

265
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:53,093
the country just
to taste some of your magic.

266
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,739
Do you really want
to disappoint them?

267
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,346
Okay, sharona.

268
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,432
I'll go out and jerk
this limp script

269
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,767
until it gets hard,

270
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,227
but I'm not doing it for herb.

271
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,686
I'm doing it for the fans.

272
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,313
And your 30k an episode.

273
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,440
Let's give it up
for bojack horseman!

274
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,776
And there better be some zimas

275
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,736
in my dressing room
after the show.

276
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,533
Wait a minute.
This isn't the bar.

277
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,409
I got to fire my assistant.

278
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,163
You guys sound like
you're ready for a show.

279
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,292
Oh, gross. Why do I keep
trying to like zima?

280
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,089
- Talk to me, world.
- Bojack it's Princess Carolyn.

281
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:32,465
How are you doing today?

282
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,883
Well, I'll tell you my problem.

283
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,469
I just keep getting handsomer.

284
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,054
Good problems to have.

285
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:39,389
Hold for a sec.

286
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:40,825
I've got your agent on the line.

287
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,852
Bojack goddamn horseface.

288
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:48,273
I got some news so good,
you'll goddamn kiss me.

289
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,649
Put it here. Put it here.

290
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,234
What's the role
you've been dying

291
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:52,902
to play your whole life,

292
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,864
besides Kathy Ireland's
bathing suit?

293
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,533
Ha-ha. She is attractive.

294
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,872
Good god, when I die,
Bury me in Kathy Ireland.

295
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,832
Uh, Marv? Marv?

296
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,375
What's the big news?

297
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:08,668
Secretariat!

298
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,171
It's happening, and it's down

299
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,882
to you and val kilmer
for the title role.

300
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,258
That's amazing.

301
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,843
Thank you. Thank you.

302
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,386
Now, listen.

303
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,430
I don't want to see you
in any more tabloids.

304
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,558
Keep your head down
and your nose clean.

305
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:24,851
Now, I gotta go.

306
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,770
I got a lunch with mc scat Kat.

307
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,232
Scandal breaking today

308
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,818
surrounding the family sitcom,
horsin ' around.

309
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:35,570
Oh, god.
What did I do this time?

310
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:37,572
Herb kazaz, the show's creator,

311
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,241
was caught tonight
in an LAPD sting

312
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,910
- on public indecency.
- Wha...

313
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,762
Police say Mr. Kazaz
was caught in the middle

314
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,872
of lewd acts with another man.

315
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,082
Conservative groups have
been quick to organize.

316
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,501
Horsin'around
is a show for kids.

317
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,213
My family should be able
to watch those nubile preteens

318
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,673
without men
like perv kazaz flaunting

319
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,009
their alternative lifestyles
and ruining america.

320
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,269
Bojack, I gotta tell ya.

321
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,772
- I'm gay.
- No doy.

322
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:14,108
I know we haven't been close
for the past couple years.

323
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,628
Okay, I'm gonna hold back
my "no doys"

324
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:16,754
because there might be a lot.

325
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:17,987
But you know me, right?

326
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,614
You know that I'm a good guy.

327
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,366
They're gunning for me
at the network,

328
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,910
and if I get kicked off this,
I won't recover.

329
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,745
I need to know that
you've got my back.

330
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:28,790
If you threaten to walk,
they'll listen to you.

331
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,042
Herb, you picked
the worst possible time to...

332
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:34,254
Hey, you know I wouldn't
ask if I didn't need it.

333
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,256
Come on, bojack.

334
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,424
How'd we get so far apart, huh?

335
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,554
You know what?
You can count on me, herb.

336
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,841
I mean, I wouldn't even be here
if it weren't for you.

337
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,226
I knew it!
I knew you'd come through.

338
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,061
And when this is all over,
we're going

339
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,688
to drive back up
to Griffith park.

340
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,982
I still owe you
that high five, right?

341
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,608
Hey, this is a dumb question,

342
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,655
but do you guys ever,
like, all link up together

343
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,612
and do, like, a party train
or a fun circle?

344
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,257
'Cause I feel like
I'd be doing that all the...

345
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,448
Never mind. Stupid question.

346
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,075
Feel stupid for asking that.

347
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,205
Go right ahead.

348
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,332
And then it goes,
"I like healthy gums

349
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,792
in a major way."

350
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,311
See, that's
what I'm talking about.

351
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,753
That's great.

352
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,856
We just gotta make sure
that we work in the phrase

353
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,176
"toothbrush rap" early,
so they know I'm rapping.

354
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,596
Bojack,
can we chat for a second?

355
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:29,309
Ugh. Here we go.
It's the big one.

356
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,769
I'm not gonna waste
your time with small talk

357
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,938
because you work for me,
and your time is my time.

358
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,648
We're letting herb go.

359
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,415
- You can't do that.
- "I can't do that."

360
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,235
I'm not asking you.
It's nothing personal.

361
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,321
I like herb.
I think he's a good guy.

362
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,947
But this is a business,
and every day

363
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,633
we don't fire him,
we're flushing money

364
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,417
- down the crapper.
- Well, if he goes, I go.

365
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,761
"Well, if he goes, you go."
I wouldn't do that.

366
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,329
Bojack, I think you're a star,

367
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,457
and sometimes being a star
means making tough choices.

368
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,709
You can storm out,
make a big show out of

369
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,085
what a "good" friend you are,

370
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,004
or you could be
the guy who does his job.

371
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,464
- Angela...
- I'll tell you when

372
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,257
it's your turn to talk again.

373
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,384
Look, you're a star,
but this is really just

374
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,678
the beginning of
the bojack horseman story.

375
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,097
You can choose
whatever path you want,

376
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,640
but I'll tell you right now.

377
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,309
You don't win awards
and you don't

378
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,227
get to be on the covers
of magazines

379
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,063
and you don't get
to play the lead role

380
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,899
in the secretariat movie
by being a good friend.

381
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,610
What's that old expression
about how the show must go on?

382
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,446
Oh, right.
It's "don't be an idiot."

383
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,741
So what do you think, bojack?
That's a courtesy question.

384
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:29,369
I already know what you think
because I have conversations

385
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,037
like this one five times a day.

386
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,997
I know who you are, and I know

387
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,224
you've already
made your decision.

388
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,750
But if you want to surprise me,

389
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,210
now's the time to do it.

390
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,045
That's what I thought.

391
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,148
You're doing the right thing,
and I know it's hard.

392
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,174
But if herb's really your
friend, he'll understand.

393
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:45,218
Now, you've got
a show to put on,

394
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,677
so I'll let you get ready.

395
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,055
This was a good conversation.
Productive.

396
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:52,850
If you're lucky,
I'll never talk to you again.

397
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,190
You folks ready for a show?

398
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,360
'Cause I think a certain someone

399
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,529
might show up any second.

400
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,138
Wait a minute.

401
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,664
This isn't the bar.

402
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,666
I gotta fire my assistant.

403
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,256
So what ended up happening
with secretariat?

404
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,882
Went into turnaround.

405
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,693
I don't totally know
what "turnaround" means,

406
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,512
- but they never made the movie.
- Whoa.

407
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,723
This house is way bigger
than yours.

408
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,726
Herb's done really well
for a guy you clicked over.

409
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,493
- Oh, no. Ah.
- That's enough out of you.

410
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,000
Stay out here
and turn this car around

411
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,815
in case we need to leave
in a hurry.

412
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:42,775
Hooray. A task.

413
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,407
Bojack! Well.

414
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:51,117
Jesus, you look shitty.

415
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,744
Have you been eating your guilt
this whole time?

416
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,208
Yeah, you don't look
so hot yourself, herb.

417
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,503
I have cancer.

418
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,839
And hello.
Who's this stunning creature?

419
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,382
And what string of bad decisions

420
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:07,925
has placed you
in bojack's orbit?

421
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,469
- Uh...
- This is Diane.

422
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,970
She's writing a book about me.

423
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,680
Pleasure to meet you.

424
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,891
Is your book called,
portrait of an asshole?

425
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,642
I kid.

426
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,561
It's funny,
because he ruined my life.

427
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,021
I joke. It's what I do.

428
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:21,355
Please, come in.

429
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,583
You're letting out
all the cancer.

430
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:23,816
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

431
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,861
Ha ha...

432
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,446
Almost. Ah...

433
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,740
Almost there.

434
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,867
Come on... ah.

435
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:35,161
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

436
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,997
Bojack, how are your utensils?

437
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,707
- Uh, they're fine.
- Are you sure?

438
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,501
Because if that knife
ain't sharp enough,

439
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,378
I got another that you left
in my back 20 years ago.

440
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,023
Could have seen that coming.

441
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:47,256
Who asks about utensils?

442
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,583
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

443
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,259
Nope. No, you are not.

444
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:53,888
Oh. Ow. Almost.

445
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,975
- Drive, drive, drive!
- Oh. Oh, no.

446
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,810
I can't turn the car around.

447
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,057
I've been trying to do this
three-point turn forever.

448
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,398
I mean, it's more
like a 300-point turn.

449
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,005
- Am I right, huh?
- Hee hee hee hee!

450
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,485
Hey, we've got two sacks

451
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:09,412
of Kardashian swag
and the fuzz on our heels.

452
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,906
You think this is driver's ed,
you hat-wearing pussy?

453
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:15,409
Drive the goddamn car!

454
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,330
Hey, herb,

455
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,916
is that your vitamix?

456
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,209
Bojack has one, too.

457
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,669
I wonder if you guys have

458
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,964
strong opinions about it
one way or the other.

459
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,770
Well, the stupid thing
was like 600 bucks.

460
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:31,842
I have used mine
a grand total of zero times.

461
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,136
I got it a month before
I was diagnosed with cancer.

462
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,073
I don't give a shit
about being healthy anymore.

463
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,824
I don't even have cancer,
and I don't use it.

464
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,100
- So who's it for?
- Exactly.

465
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:40,977
What is so great about liquids?

466
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:44,105
Every article I read now is
"juice this" and "juice that."

467
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,399
You know why?
Juice controls the media.

468
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,819
Hey-hooh.

469
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,696
Can't this thing go any faster?

470
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,073
Uh, I'm going as fast as I can.

471
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,554
Do you want me to get out?
Try to guide you?

472
00:17:58,578 --> 00:17:59,829
No, I think I'm almost there.

473
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,205
You're doing a great job.

474
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:03,416
Kenzie, stop talking to him.

475
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,501
Why? He's being nice.

476
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:06,788
Remember the number one rule

477
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,337
of the celebrity stealing club...

478
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,256
- "No falling in love."
- Ugh.

479
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,425
That's your rule for every club.

480
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,302
It's a good rule.

481
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,470
Whoa. Whoa, guys.

482
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,848
I'm sensing a lot
of hostility here.

483
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:22,435
Maybe we should take
our masks off and actually talk.

484
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,937
You want me to take
my mask off? Fine.

485
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,189
Happy? I took my mask off.

486
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,691
Did you?

487
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:31,944
Because I think
you're still wearing a mask.

488
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,530
Oh.

489
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,991
Oh, my god, herb,
you met President Clinton?

490
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,492
Oh, yeah. Many times.

491
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,095
Did you think that
I spent the last 20 years

492
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,871
on my couch just feeling
sorry for myself?

493
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:44,040
I mean, I did do that,
but I also started...

494
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,125
A charity to bring clean water

495
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,092
to millions of children
in Sub-Saharan Africa.

496
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,462
Oh, wow.

497
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,109
I presented at
the teen choice awards.

498
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,965
Wait, is that Charlotte?

499
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,292
Yeah, yeah. We kept in touch.

500
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:55,885
You should actually
give her a call.

501
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,720
I'm sure she'd
love to hear from you.

502
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,472
She looks good
for someone so old.

503
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:00,866
She's three years younger
than you.

504
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,808
Exactly!

505
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,644
Er?

506
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,562
Well, guys, I'm pretty beat.

507
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,049
I think I need to
head off to bed,

508
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,505
and I hope
I actually wake up later.

509
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:15,071
And it was actually nice
to see you, bojack.

510
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,317
You can see yourselves out.

511
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,992
"Juice controls the media."

512
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,787
I love it.

513
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:25,915
So I guess in a sense

514
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,541
I'm running away from the cops,

515
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,795
but I feel like in another,
truer sense,

516
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,880
I'm running away from myself.

517
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,174
- Truth. Truth.
- Whoa.

518
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,468
Kenzie, do you have
anything to share?

519
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:39,428
Just how amazing it feels
to finally

520
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,595
be honest for once.

521
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,139
I could live a million lives,

522
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,058
and I'd never forget
this one afternoon.

523
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:45,309
Word.

524
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:46,602
You know, I act all cool

525
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,604
and sophisticated
on the outside,

526
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:51,899
but on the inside,
I'm just Todd, you know?

527
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,026
But thanks to you guys,
I think I'm finally

528
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,879
- ready to let my guard down.
- Do you hear that?

529
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,905
- He's letting his guard down.
- Let's get him!

530
00:19:58,072 --> 00:19:59,407
Oh!

531
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,742
Celebrity stealing club
strikes again.

532
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:09,667
This... this just doesn't
feel right.

533
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,627
I should have brought
a bottle of wine.

534
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:13,838
That's what adults do.
Bojack, damn it.

535
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,756
Is that what's bothering you,

536
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,651
- that you didn't bring wine?
- You're right.

537
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:19,069
I just would have drunk it
on the way here.

538
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,886
This isn't about wine, bojack.

539
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,889
If you have something
you need to say to someone,

540
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,559
you should do it
while you have the chance

541
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:29,061
because before you know it,
it'll be too late.

542
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,456
Is this one of those things
where we're talking

543
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,800
about herb but we're actually
talking about something else?

544
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,610
- No, I was talking about herb.
- Okay, good. Yeah, me, too.

545
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,280
Hey, buddy!

546
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:41,490
You come back
for that vitamix you...

547
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,161
Ooh, you should get that
looked at.

548
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,663
Yeah. I've been meaning
to see a doctor.

549
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:51,000
Hey, I wanted to talk
to you about... you know.

550
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:55,629
I feel bad about what happened.

551
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,798
So you're apologizing.

552
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,092
Yes. I'm sorry.

553
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,136
Okay. I don't forgive you.

554
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:03,596
Herb, I said I'm sorry.

555
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,390
Yeah, and I do not forgive you.

556
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:09,435
Uh... not sure you get
what's happening here.

557
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,604
This could be
the last time that you...

558
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,023
No. I'm not gonna
give you closure.

559
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,483
You don't get that.

560
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,151
You have to live

561
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:18,736
with the shitty thing you did

562
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:20,154
for the rest of your life.

563
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:22,031
You have to know that
it's never,

564
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:23,574
ever going to be okay.

565
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:25,659
I really think that we'd both

566
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,386
- feel better if we just...
- I'm dying.

567
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:28,996
I'm not gonna feel better,

568
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:31,290
and I'm not gonna be your prop
so you can feel better.

569
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,125
You have to believe me.

570
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,752
- I did everything I could.
- Yeah?

571
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,879
Then why didn't you call me?
Huh?

572
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,298
20 years... you didn't call me.

573
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,884
Look, I... I wanted to,
but I didn't think...

574
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:43,320
You know what
it was like for me?

575
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:45,387
I had nobody. Everybody left.

576
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,324
I knew all those showbiz phonies
would turn on me.

577
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:48,599
Sure. But you?

578
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:50,267
It's not my fault you got fired.

579
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,353
I don't care about the job!

580
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,523
I did fine. I had a good life.

581
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,650
But what I needed then
was a friend,

582
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,819
and you abandoned me.

583
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:03,155
And I will never forgive you
for that.

584
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,826
Now, get the fuck
out of my house.

585
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,559
Hey, this is a dumb question,
but the gay thing

586
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,186
and the rectal cancer thing
aren't related, are they?

587
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,450
- Get out of here!
- Never mind.

588
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:19,672
Stupid question.
Forget I brought it up.

589
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,216
- Huh.
- Hey, bj.

590
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:24,718
- Put that back, asshole!
- No, you gave this to me.

591
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:25,928
No!

592
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,140
Bojack?

593
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,977
What are you doing? Get off him.

594
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,080
The show was never the same
after I left... admit it.

595
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:39,149
Some people prefer
the later years.

596
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,777
Bojack. Come on.

597
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:44,405
Thank you for inviting us.

598
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:46,574
You have a lovely home.

599
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,117
You know what your problem is?

600
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,452
You want to think of yourself
as the good guy.

601
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,413
Well, I know you better
than anyone,

602
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,748
and I can tell you
that you're not.

603
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:58,043
In fact, you'd probably sleep
a lot better at night

604
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,837
if you just admitted to yourself

605
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:02,172
that you're a selfish
goddamn coward

606
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:05,134
who takes whatever he wants
and doesn't give a shit

607
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:06,635
about who he hurts.

608
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,972
That's you.
That's bojack horseman.

609
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:13,225
I don't know why I came here.

610
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:16,812
Yeah. You do.

611
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:21,150
Princess Carolyn:
You said you wanted a job.

612
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:24,153
It doesn't matter.
Nothing matters.

613
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,238
Wow. What happened in Malibu?

614
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,449
I gotta go.

615
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:30,576
Hey, bright side.

616
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,578
At least now you have
a good story to tell

617
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,622
at his funeral.

618
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,749
Ugh, god.

619
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,679
I'm not trying
to kill the vibe here,

620
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,307
but I've had to pee
for, like, three hours.

621
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:56,624
Look, I won't put
what happened today

622
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,354
in the book
if you don't want me to.

623
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,772
No, it's okay.

624
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,857
Full truth like we agreed.

625
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,025
Warts and all.

626
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:04,568
It doesn't matter anyway.

627
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,737
I don't even care what anybody
thinks anymore.

628
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:08,280
Well, for what it's worth,

629
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,823
I think it took a lot of guts

630
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,325
to do what you did back there.

631
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,371
- Mmm...
- Mm!

632
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:34,723
J“ back in the '903 j”

633
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:39,770
j“ I was in a very famous TV show j“

634
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,857
- I“ I'm bojack the horse j“
- I bojack j“

635
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,275
j“ bojack the horse I”

636
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:49,238
j“ don't act like you don't know I

637
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:55,494
j“ and I'm trying to hold on to my past j“

638
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:56,996
j“ it's been so long I“

639
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:00,499
j“ I don't think I'm gonna last j“

640
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:01,834
j“ I guess I'll just try I”

641
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:04,003
j“ and make you understand I“

642
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:08,382
j“ that I'm more horse than a man j'

643
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:13,012
j“ or I'm more man than a horse j“

644
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,346
j“ bojack j“

645
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,270
It's a kazzaz-trophe.
