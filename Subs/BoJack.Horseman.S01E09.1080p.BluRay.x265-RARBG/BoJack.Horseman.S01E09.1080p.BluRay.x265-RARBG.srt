00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,051
[Laughs]

178
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,136
Oh, wow. We make a great pair.

179
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:12,015
It's like I'm miss Daisy,
and you're minnie driver.

180
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,893
[Lawn mower rattling]

181
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,561
[Phone beeps] Hey, I'm bored.

182
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,563
And I think Todd swallowed
a cyanide pill

183
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,773
and might be dead.

184
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,167
Wanna come over and bang it out?

185
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,567
Appealing as that sounds,

186
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,444
I have lunch plans with Vincent.

187
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,446
I know that might be hard
for you to hear.

188
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,949
Wait, that guy from the bar
who is actually three boys

189
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,076
stacked on top of each other
under a trench coat?

190
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,119
Well, don't fly into
a jealous rage about it.

191
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,412
Not jealous.

192
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,015
Just reminding you that
you are trying

193
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,099
to have a relationship
with someone who is...

194
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,541
And again, it's bizarre

195
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,645
I should have to point
this out... three young boys

196
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,796
stacked on top of each other
under a trench coat.

197
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,881
He listens to me.

198
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,734
Okay, okay, but can
you just acknowledge that...

199
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,069
- That you are being jealous?
- Oh, oh!

200
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,403
[Glass shatters]
Already acknowledged.

201
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,845
Toodles. [Phone beeps]

202
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,014
- Look who's not dead.
- Better than not dead.

203
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:56,226
You are looking at
Mr. Peanutbutter's new driver.

204
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,520
You're his driver?
That's perfect.

205
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:01,481
Now you can infiltrate
Mr. Peanutbutter's inner circle.

206
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,316
I don't know, bojack.

207
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,683
Sure, you'll act all friendly,

208
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,361
gain his trust,
chauffer him around

209
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,571
on his little errands
to the groomer and whatnot,

210
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,740
but all the while,
you'll be studying him,

211
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,534
scouring out his weaknesses,

212
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:15,412
biding your time
till we're ready to strike.

213
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,998
And once you zero in
on his achilles' heel,

214
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:22,252
we will take... him... down.

215
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:26,381
Hooray. Betrayal.

216
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:29,050
Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man.
Oh, no, no, no, no.

217
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,343
Oh, man. Oh, man.

218
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,790
- Keep it cool, Todd.
- Hey, pal.

219
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,596
If you're making
small talk up there,

220
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,057
how about sending
a little my way?

221
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:39,019
Um... can you believe
this weather we're having?

222
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:43,732
No, I cannot believe
this weather we're having!

223
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,068
[Doorbell rings, horse neighs]

224
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,295
Hey, weren't you supposed
to be here

225
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,654
like a half hour ago?

226
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,198
Yeah, I've just been
sitting in my car.

227
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,533
[Chuckles]

228
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,535
Listen, I was looking
over my notes,

229
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,662
and I think I have enough
to go write the book,

230
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:01,916
so... I'm just going to do that.

231
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,918
You don't want
to interview me anymore?

232
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,885
But don't you want to know
what my rosebud is?

233
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,964
You told me repeatedly
it was the nudie magazine

234
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,817
your uncle showed you
with the three-nippled woman.

235
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,676
- Who was she?
- I got it all.

236
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,178
Oh, okay.

237
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,822
Well, I'll see you
around though, right?

238
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,265
Yeah. I, um...

239
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:21,519
Why did you have to make
things weird, bojack?

240
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,563
[Car door opens, closes]

241
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,982
I made things weird?

242
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,859
So if you see anything

243
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,706
you know we need,
like this biscuit warmer,

244
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,613
you just run the laser
over the barcode,

245
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,780
and kablamsky! [Beep]

246
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,115
It goes in the registry.

247
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,801
And that way, everybody knows
what I want.

248
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,368
- And I know what I want.
- Uh...

249
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,828
Which is what everyone wants.

250
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,205
And it's really clear,

251
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,831
and nobody's confused
about anything.

252
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,501
Am I crazy,
or are you not into this?

253
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,753
No, I am. It's just... [sighs]

254
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,714
The big wedding in nantucket,
all these presents...

255
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,591
I'm so overwhelmed,
I can barely consider

256
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,094
whether I want or need
a biscuit warmer,

257
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,113
which I think is how people
end up with biscuit warmers.

258
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,139
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

259
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,933
Close your eyes. Come on.

260
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,726
Okay, picture
our lives together.

261
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:04,062
It's a cold Sunday morning
a bunch of years from now.

262
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:06,272
Maybe robots have taken over,
maybe they haven't.

263
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,541
I don't know. It's the future.

264
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:08,983
This story isn't about that.

265
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,944
The important thing is
it's Sunday morning.

266
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,488
I brought you the paper,
fetched your slippers.

267
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:16,699
You come into the kitchen...
Can you smell biscuits?

268
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,119
- Yes.
- So can I.

269
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,745
- Are they warm?
- Yeah.

270
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,831
Well, that's all
a biscuit warmer's for.

271
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,749
Look, if marriage
stresses you out,

272
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,376
we don't have to get married.

273
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:27,877
It's not the marriage.

274
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,547
It's the wedding
and the year of build-up.

275
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,048
So forget all that.

276
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:33,400
I've done
the whole big wedding thing.

277
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,717
I don't need to do it again.

278
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,469
Let's do something
small and casual

279
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,054
right here in town next month.

280
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,390
Honestly, that would be amazing.

281
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,142
But we'd have to cancel
the doves,

282
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,668
and we wouldn't be able
to send out

283
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,145
those fancy invitations
you liked.

284
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,188
Those doves were being
jerks anyway.

285
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,982
And invitations...
They're just a scam

286
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,442
made up by the post office
to keep tabs on us.

287
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,652
Post office.

288
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,487
[Growls] Settle down, boy.

289
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,615
And then we talked about
his favorite smash mouth cds.

290
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,868
[Crunching] And... oh, oh.

291
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:03,163
And then that led to a whole
conversations about sticks.

292
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,206
Oh, and let me tell you,

293
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:09,460
Mr. Peanutbutter has got some
serious opinions about sticks.

294
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,004
Why are you telling me this?

295
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,691
What? You said
you wanted every detail.

296
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,157
Did I mention
he got a new bandana?

297
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:15,466
Give me something I can use

298
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,033
to make them call off
their wedding.

299
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,553
Oh, yeah. Did I not tell you?

300
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,905
They called off their wedding.

301
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,639
What? Thank god!

302
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,766
Oh, the universe makes sense.

303
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,536
They decided against
a big destination wedding,

304
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,769
so they're doing it here

305
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,096
- sometime next month.
- What?

306
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,606
I guess saying
they called it off

307
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:30,940
is probably not right.

308
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,107

Hey, what's this?

311
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,780
Oh, yes, I got jury duty,

312
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,258
but I can't worry
about that right now.

313
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:40,682
That is a problem for
Friday bojack.

314
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,994
Now think, Todd.
Gotta have something I can use

pot-infused jell-o shot

- you call a brain.
- Let's see.

317
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:51,044
Mr. Peanutbutter likes having
his tummy scratched,

318
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,046
and Diane's family
is from Vietnam,

319
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:56,424
which is where Vietnamese food
comes from,

320
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,801
and since that goes
in your tummy...

321
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,571
Okay, stop thinking.
Just give me raw data.

322
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:01,675
What's happening this week?

323
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,348
Well, the circus is in town.

324
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,367
Congress is going to vote
on the new education bill...

325

With Mr. Peanutbutter!

What's happening
with Mr. Peanutbutter?

327
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,271
Well, I'm taking Diane and him

328
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,940
to the bank on Thursday.

329
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:15,109
I can use that.
I can actually use that.

330
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,362
I don't know if I'm up

331
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,615
for staging
a bank robbery, bojack.

332
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,785
Oh, come on, character
actress margo martindale.

no good parts

I want to stick an ak-47

336

in your hand
and prove them wrong.

I do tire of the limitations

338

of stage, film, and television.

You might as well perform
in a cage, am I right?

This is guerilla theater...

No stage, no script, no net.

342
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,093
It's the kind of work
we talked about

343
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,095
during that night in the desert.

344
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,681
Don't tell me we left
those dreams in the sweat lodge.

345

Hell, I'll do it.

00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,022
Bojack horseman?

349
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,399
Oh. Hi.

350
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:55,692
What a weird coincidence.

351
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,378
I did not know
you would be here today.

352
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,570
How are... things?

353
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:00,947
Things are good. You?

354
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,365
Things good with you?

355
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:03,759
Hands behind your head,
everybody.

356
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,952
Nobody moves, nobody gets shot.

357
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,204
- [Gaspsi
- what an unfortunate surprise.

358
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,415
Well, well,
isn't that a pretty ring?

359
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,916
- {gasps} - [Coughs] Next one.

360
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,294
Well, well,
isn't that a pretty ring?

361
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,670
I'll take it.

362
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,046
But it's my engagement ring.

363
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,381
Give it to her, Diane.

364
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,091
- It's just a ring.
- Just a ring?

365
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,385
That ring is a symbol
of your love.

366
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,220
If you don't care
about the ring,

367
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,264
it really makes me wonder
if you care about

368
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:27,974
the woman wearing it.

369
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,309
That terrifying bank robber

370
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,269
is making
some very cogent points.

371
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:32,854
No, Mr. Peanutbutter's right.

372
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,273
If the ring is
just a symbol for love,

373
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,649
why would I need a symbol

374
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,359
when I have the real thing
right here?

375
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,528
Yeah, we don't need rings,
we have each other.

376
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:43,156
Hey, why are we even waiting
a month to get married?

377
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,742
If anything, this bank robbery
is reminding me

378
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,368
that life is short.

379
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,911
We should get married
even sooner!

380
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,121
[Softly] No...

381
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:51,289
What do you mean sooner?

382
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:52,457
Why not this weekend?

383
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,334
We could get married Saturday.

384
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,626
Am I crazy?

385
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,378
[Softly] Yes. Don't do it.

386
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,006
- Oh, keep the damn thing.
- Aw.

387
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,257
[Applause]

388
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,343
Okay. Saturday it is.

389
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,677
What the hell just happened?

390
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,637
Something truly beauti...

391
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:07,804
Aah!

392
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,090
- Oh.
- Get your hands off me!

393
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,182
[Taser crackles] Uh-oh.

394
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,726
[Landing blows]

395
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:14,979
[Laughs] Long story short,

396
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,647
Erika did have to lose the foot,

397
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,025
but she gained a friend.

398
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,902
Sorry, kind of went off
on a tangent there.

399
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:22,445
Diane and I wanna thank you all

400
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,864
for coming to our
impromptu rehearsal dinner,

401
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,741
even though
we did not actually have time

402
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,993
- to organize a rehearsal.
- Or a dinner.

403
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,287
But there is an open bar...

404
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:32,747
[Cheers and applause]

405
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,434
Which you are
all welcome to partake in

406
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,209
as soon as I finish this toast,

407
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:39,587
which I will be doing right...

408
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:40,963
After one more quick anecdote.

409
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,566
[Guests groan]
It was winter in Prague,

410
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,258
and the consumption hung low
in the air.

411
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,611
Well, the bank thing was a dud.

412
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:46,803
Thanks a lot, Todd.

413
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,289
Well, you win some,
you lose some.

414
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,764
It's like Vincent always says...

415
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:51,140
- "Oopsy_“ - Vincent?

416
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,667
Yeah,
Princess Carolyn's boyfriend.

417
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,143
We've hung out
a couple of times.

418
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,950
- What are you ta...
- That dude is funny.

419
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,647
You know he's not
a person, right?

420
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:58,940
Look, I don't want to get

421
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:00,292
in the middle
of your whole thing

422
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,401
with Princess Carolyn.

423
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,735
It's not about that.

424
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,129
I just don't understand
why nobody else

425
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,672
seems to notice
that she is dating a man

426
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:06,989
who is clearly three little boys

427
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,075
doing the thing
from the little rascals.

428
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,035
Oh, that reminds me
of another funny story.

429
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:13,079
[Clinks glass]
If I could say a few words?

430
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,415
Bojack horseman. Take the mic.

431
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,791
Spin us a yarn.

432
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,418
Mr. Peanutbutter, Diane.

433
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,961
Since I am friends
with both of you

434
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,004
- and have no ulterior motives...
- Mm-hmm.

435
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,531
I would like to offer
my restaurant

436
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,841
as a venue for your wedding.

437
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,509
Wow! Really?

438
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,469
I don't know.
That's too generous.

439
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,597
Hey, don't look a horse's gift
in the mouth, right?

440
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,807
[Laughter]

441
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,934
I get it. Like the song.

442
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,101
That's not a song.

443
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,437
All right, everyone.

444
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,688
That's it for the toasts.

445
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,482
Enjoy yourselves and each other.

446
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,443
[Dance music plays]

447
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,986
This is perfect.

448
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:46,737
Now that the wedding's
at my restaurant,

449
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,698
we have
the home field advantage.

450
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,283
Perfect for sabotage.

451
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,452
Bojack, I need to thank you.

452
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,662
You calling me to the bar
the other night

453
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,069
turned out to be the best thing

454
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,123
that ever happened to me.

455
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,666
- I think I'm in love.
- Okay.

456
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,251
This person
you're in love with...

457
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,146
Have you seen him
without his trench coat on?

458
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,939
I don't understand why
you can't be happy for me.

459
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,381
He's a good boyfriend.

460
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:06,966
I actually think you and Vincent

461
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,218
would really hit it off
if you gave him a chance.

462
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,225
You should spend some
one-on-one time with him.

463
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,555
You mean one-on-three time?

464
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,223
Because there are three of him.

465
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,142
We get it. You don't like him.

466
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,727
I'm actually not sure
you do get it.

467
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,189
[Zipper]
I know what's been going on.

468
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,607
Ah! I wasn't gonna pee.

469
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,025
I was just taking my penis out.

470
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:25,735
You've been driving me around,

471
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,880
but there was something else
happening the whole time.

472
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:28,905
I see it now.

473
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,823
What are you talking about?

474
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,826
You weren't just working
as my driver, Todd.

475
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,412
You were becoming my friend.

476
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,831
Oh, yeah. That was happening.

477
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,833
Well, I could use a friend
right about now.

478
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,960
There's something I really
gotta get off my chest,

479
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:46,464
and if it got out, it could
destroy the whole wedding.

480
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:49,008
No, I'm not great
with sensitive information.

481
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,052
I don't know if I'm ready
to get married again.

482
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:53,971
Don't get me wrong.
I love Diane so much.

483
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,139
I didn't have any doubts

484
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,391
until I realized she had doubts.

485
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,769
Then I figured
she's smarter than I am.

486
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,187
Maybe she knows things I don't.

487
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,855
You are kind of unloading a lot

488
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,732
sensitive information here.

489
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:06,817
Sure, I think I'm ready
to commit to Diane,

490
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,070
but I can't even commit
to my favorite type of stick.

491
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:12,406
Yes, today, it's short
and knobby, but tomorrow?

492
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,076
Well, sure, Diane is short,
but I don't know about knobby.

493
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:17,161
The last thing I want to do
is hurt Diane,

494
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,455
but I keep having this dream
where she's gone.

495
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,165
There's no break-up, no tragedy.

496
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,626
She's just gone, and my life
continues without her.

497
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,378
And it terrifies me to say this,

498
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,256
but in the dream I feel...
Relief.

to all this.

Since you weren't able
to give me any useful intel,

without contributing

we make a pretty good team,
don't we, Todd?

00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:18,180
and ruined my rock opera.

524
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,932
She's the one who asked me

525
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,060
to hand her that tape
from the 10¢ bin.

526
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:27,732
[Gasps] That means
margo martindale likes tapes!

527
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,692
And a tape is something
you listen to,

528
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,527
but tape is also a sticky thing

529
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:33,487
you can use to seal boxes.

530
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,032
Boxes is what cereal comes in.

531
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,659
What does it all mean?

532
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,536
Am I just grasping at straws?

533
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:43,789
Wait. Straws... that's it.

534
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,293
Straws are used
to drink soda or water,

535
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,919
and plants need water.

536
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:53,382
And bojack used margo martindale
as a plant

537
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:58,262
at the bank
and the convenience store,

538
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:00,848
which means... ugh!

539
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:03,809
Bojack hired margo martindale

540
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,811
to make me find that video game

541
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:10,066
so he could kill my rock opera!

542
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,609
Aw, dude.

543
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:17,531
- Rise and shine, Todd.
- I didn't sleep.

544
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,384
Well, we're down to the wire,
but we still got

545
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,345
one more day to figure out
how to stop this wedding,

546
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:23,537
and I can't afford to waste
one second, so let's get...

547
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,539
Oh, shit.
Forgot about jury duty.

548
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,166
Damn you, Tuesday bojack.

549
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:35,216
- And so, you saw the defendant.
- Yes.

550
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:39,095
That man, the defendant...
You saw him?

551
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,721
Come on, come on, come on.
Hurry up.

552
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:44,684
- That's correct.
- The defendant was seen by you.

553
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,935
Sweet Jesus.

554
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,520
Some of us have weddings
to ruin.

555
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:48,771
Yes.

556
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,439
No further questions,
your honor.

557
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,733
I'm sorry. I misspoke.

558
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,735
A lot of further questions.

559
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,028
[Groans]

560
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:04,620
The jury finds the defendant
not guilty on all charges.

561
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:05,871
[Voices cheering]

562
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,707
We did the right thing today,
bojack.

563
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,273
But you know who
the real winner is?

564
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,293
- Justice.
- Mr. Peanutbutter.

565
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,213
[Sighs]

566
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,380
Bojack.

567
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,383
There's my superstar.

568
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,926
- How are you?
- Amazing!

569
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,220
This has been
the role of a lifetime.

570
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,514
I think they're gonna
send me up to lompoc,

571
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:25,891
and when I get there,
I'm gonna find

572
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,394
the meanest, hardest queen bitch
of the yard,

573
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,105
and I'm going to bite
her finger off.

574
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:33,482
[Laughs] That'll show everyone
I'm crazy,

575
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,109
and you don't mess with crazy.

576
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:36,610
Plus, free finger.

577
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,155
Oh, here I am blabbering
on about my plans.

578
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,198
Did you ever stop that wedding?

579
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,685
It's actually happening
right now.

580
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,243
I ran out of time.

581
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,661
I never understood why

582
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,548
it was so important to keep
those two apart.

583
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,020
I was just trying to be
a good friend

584
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,876
in my own
shitty, ass-backwards way.

585
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,627
Diane deserves the best.

586
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,421
She's smart
and kind and beautiful,

587
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,965
and it's gonna be
mostly synonyms from here on

588
00:20:58,132 --> 00:20:59,800
if I keep going,

589
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,719
and I'm in love with her.

590
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:03,429
Tell her that, bojack.

591
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:06,557
You don't need kooky schemes
or nutty capers.

592
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:09,769
Just go to her
and speak from your heart.

593
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,646
Then find the biggest person
at the wedding

594
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,398
and bite his finger off!

595
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,192
You're right, partly.

596
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,110
I've gotta tell her how I feel.

597
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,987
Okay, I'm gonna do it.

598
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:21,822
Good luck with
your finger thing.

599
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,158
[Tires screech]

600
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:25,325
[Car alarm chirps]

601
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:26,744
Todd, thank god you're here!

602
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:28,111
Did I miss it? Is it too late?

603
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,705
Dude. I'm done with this.
No. No.

604
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,499
Mr. Peanutbutter's
been nice to me.

605
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:32,976
Mr. Peanutbutter
is nice to everybody.

606
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,293
That's what makes him so stupid.

607
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,295
No, I'm stupid.

608
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,672
But even I know
that the only reason

609
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,008
you're doing this is because
you're in love with Diane.

610
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:42,510
Yes, that's right.

611
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,396
And I'm here to finally
tell her how I feel.

612
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,180
Bojack, she knows how you feel.

613
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:48,224
How? I barely just realized...

614
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,643
Hey, man, she made her choice.

615
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:54,396
Look around.
This day is not about you, okay?

616
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,650
So maybe you should
just stop trying

617
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:00,778
to mess
with other people's lives.

618
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:03,364
I never thought I wanted
to get married.

619
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:04,907
It's so weird,

620
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:07,076
this idea of dedicating
yourself to something

621
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:08,327
for the rest of your life.

622
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,871
Like, how could you know, right?

623
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,375
But then I realized it's okay
to not know everything.

624
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:16,752
And some things take
a leap of faith.

625
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,463
Mr. Peanutbutter, I want
to take that leap with you.

626
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,466
By the power vested in me
by one of those dumb websites,

627
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,134
I now pronounce you married.

628
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,554
Go ahead.
Kiss, you lovesick dummies.

629
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,180
[Kisses]

630
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,347
[Cheers and applause]

631
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:35,104
[Walking on sunshine
by Katrina and the waves]

632
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,982
J“ yeah yeah j“

633
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,567
j“ I used to think maybe I

634
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,068
hey, Todd. Todd.

635
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:42,754
Thanks for hearing me out
the other night.

636
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,378
I'm really glad I went
through with this.

637
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:45,990
This is the happiest day
of my life.

638
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,408
Always happy to be of service.

639
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:49,827
Oh, and, um,
I got you something.

640
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,495
Todd Chavez?

641
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:53,289
Hey. That name's my name.

642
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:54,748
What's "pb livin'"?

643
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:57,918
My film production company.
Read your title.

644
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:02,381
"Executive vice president
of west coast operations."

645
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,467
Whoa! Does that mean
I control the waves?

646
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,344
No, it means
you're my assistant.

647
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,013
You've got a big future
ahead of you,

648
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,032
and I don't want you
to waste any time looking back.

649
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,225
So I got all my cars' mirrors
taken off.

650
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,977
Isn't that kind of dangerous?

651
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:17,479
What do I care? I'm not driving.

652
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:20,649
Hey, bojack. Thanks for coming.

653
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,256
I wasn't sure
you were gonna make it.

654
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:23,903
Wouldn't have missed it
for the world.

655
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,614
You're a good friend.
I'm really glad to know you.

656
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,116
- Mwah.
- Sorry that I...

657
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:30,492
If I made things weird.

658
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,286
They weren't that weird.

659
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:33,871
- Oh.
- Diane, honey?

660
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:35,956
Oh! I gotta go
dance with my husband.

661

00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,043
I'm married! [Giggles]

663
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:45,215
So you're the "person: Singular"

664
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,884
that everyone's so crazy about.

665
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:48,653
What have you got figured out
that I don't?

666
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,305
Um, adult stuff.

667
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:53,140
Yeah, I'm not seeing it.

668
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:55,076
But that doesn't matter.
Not everything's about me.

669
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,144
And maybe I am a little jealous.

670
00:23:57,311 --> 00:24:00,397
Not because I actually want to
date Princess Carolyn anymore,

671
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:04,360
but just because I don't like
the idea that I can't.

672
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,403
I guess I just assumed
I always could.

673
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,572
But I made
a lot of bad decisions.

674
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:11,200
Not just with her.
With... [sighs]

675
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,702
With everyone, really.

676
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,622
You know,
Princess Carolyn was right.

677
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,540
- You are a good listener.
- Thanks.

678
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,001
You know, sometimes I feel
like I was born with a leak,

679
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,629
and any goodness I started
with just slowly

680
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,631
spilled out of me,
and now it's all gone.

681
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,508
And I'll never get it
back in me.

682
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:29,259
It's too late.

683
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:34,181
Life is a series of
closing doors, isn't it?

684
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:37,226
