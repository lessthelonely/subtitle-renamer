1
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:11,303
So, did you have a good birthday?

2
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,097
- It was an amazing birthday!
- I had a great day, too.

3
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:17,476
I wish every day could be like this.
Just the two of us, together.

4
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:18,936
Yeah? You weren't too bored

5
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:21,702
by "women on the wall: An exploration
of gender in text and media,

6
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,655
Barbara kruger and Jenny holzer
in conversation with Helen molesworth“?

7
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:25,733
Are you kidding?

8
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:29,321
I loved "women on the wall: An
exploration of gender in text and media,

9
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:32,658
Barbara kruger and Jenny holzer
in conversation with Helen molesworth."

10
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,493
It combined my two favorite things:

11
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,621
Modern art
and people talking about modern art.

12
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:40,457
I loved everything about today.
Thank you.

13
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:42,834
- So, there's nothing else you want?
- No.

14
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,837
All I want is to get into bed,
listen to prairie home companion

15
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:48,090
and snuggle up
to my wonderful husband.

16
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:53,470
- You don't want anything else?
- No. Today was perfect.

17
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:59,434
- Any additional thing would be overkill.
- Okay. If you say so.

18
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,853
- Surprise!
- Oh, my god.

19
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,314
Are you surprised?
Tell me you're surprised.

20
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,985
She's speechless.
Oh, we got her good, folks.

21
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:11,113
Now let's party!

22
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:11,465
He's dead! I told you he's dead.
Why don't you ever listen to me?

23
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,592
He is dead, goddamn it!

24
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,598
- Hey, we should go.
- No, don't leave.

25
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:20,974
There's so much party left.

26
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,934
Paul McCartney's
gonna jump out of a cake.

27
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,604
Sorry, Wanda and I have to get
to a prior engagement...

28
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,606
- Party.
- A prior engagement party.

29
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:31,318
Yeah, my cousin's name is prior,
and it's a party for his engagement.

30
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,528
Engagement,
so it's a prior engagement party.

31
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,175
- What?
- And we gotta get there early

32
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,325
- because of the. Si...
- The si... silent auction!

33
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,932
- Auction, yeah... Okay.

34
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,789
To benefit berto eco's fight
against heart disease...

35
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:44,955
- Uh...
- Wareness.

36
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,958
His fight
against heart disease awareness.

37
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,086
- Gotta 90.
- Wait, bojack!

38
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:52,089
- No! You're my ride.
- Too late, Todd. Save yourself.

39
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,841
- I'll take you home.
- Come on, stick around a little.

40
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,679
Nope. I gotta take Todd home. Had
a wonderful time. Really. It just flew by.

41
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,014
- Come on, Todd, get in the car.
- Okay.

42
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,977
- I give them three months.
- Well, what makes you say that?

43
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,730
Let me think about,
what was my first clue?

44
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,108
Ah! Remember that time
at Diane's birthday party

45
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,110
when they got
in that huge screaming match

46
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,404
over whether or not
Tony Curtis was dead?

47
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,323
- That was weird.
- I don't wanna start another fight,

48
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,576
- but is he dead?
- If Tony Curtis died, I think I'd know.

49
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,537
The man's a national treasure.

50
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,957
He's the one speck of romance
in this tainted cynical world.

51
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:31,920
- I'll say. His cereal is great! Look out!
- What?

52
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,131
Ooh!

53
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,467
- Vincent?
- Ooh.

54
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,345
- That kid looks just like my boyfriend.
- Does he?

55
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:41,906
I'd know that face anywhere.

56
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,891
Well, hey, people look
like people all the time.

57
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,686
A lot of folks say
that I look like octavia Spencer

58
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:51,565
or the prince of cordovia or that guy
from the guten bourbon ads.

59
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,609
How could I have been so stupid?
This is why he never invited me

60
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,987
to his house,
why I've never met any of his friends.

61
00:03:57,154 --> 00:04:00,407
- What are you saying?
- Vincent has a secret family.

62
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:05,579
That kid was his son.
The lady was his wife. Oh, I'm a fool.

63
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,832
- Where are we going?
- I need a drink.

64
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:13,295
- Are you gonna take me home first?
- You better call me back, asshole.

65
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,130
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

66
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,382
It's like you're three different people.

67
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:20,635
- So, you're not gonna take me home first?
- Should I call him again?

68
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,888
I'm sure there's a simple explanation.

69
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,849
Ugh. No wonder he wears a trench coat
all the time.

70
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,517
It's because he's so sneaky.

71
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,103
Princess Carolyn.

72
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,730
Oh, my god, that's him!

73
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:35,358
Quick, jump out the window, shimmy
down the drainpipe and wait in the car.

74
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,444
- What?
- Vincent has a terrible temper.

75
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,862
He throws tantrums.

76
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,990
If he finds you in my apartment,
who knows what he's capable of?

77
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:45,368
But, also, stay close,
because if he finds me alone,

78
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,370
who knows what he's capable of?

79
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,916
Fine. You're lucky I love shimmying.

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,044
- Looking young.
- Aah!

81
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,756
-Huh?

82
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:02,511
My name's Kevin. I promise you,
there is an explanation for all this.

83
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,680
Nice to meet you, Kevin.
Where's your daddy?

84
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:10,310
He's, uh, looking for parking.
He'll be up in a minute.

85
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:15,398
- I have to pee.
- Okay, the bathroom is just back there.

86
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:21,655
Ah. Herb.

87
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,407
Oh, nope.

88
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:27,786
It's a prairie home companion.

89
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,706
Phone, I'm bored.

90
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,793
I am sorry to hear that, Todd.

91
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,711
How many ounces are in a barrel?

92
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:41,132
A barrel has 4032 fluid ounces.

93
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,385
Well, I'm out of questions.

94
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,554
Do you have any questions for me?

95
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,766
I do have a question, Todd.
What is love?

96
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,940
Well, well, well,
look what the me dragged in.

97
00:05:57,107 --> 00:06:00,569
Is it dragged or drug?
Either way, drop dead.

98
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,445
Princess Carolyn, listen.

99
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,824
Kevin is my son, but I'm divorced.

100
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,660
And Kevin is in the bathroom
and I'm standing right here,

101
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,580
so as you can see
we're clearly two different people:

102
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,748
One adult and one child.

103
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,918
- Okay, bye!
- Not so fast, cowboy.

104
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,421
I'm not a cowboy, I'm a cow-man.

105
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:22,382
- I'm a man-man.
- Why didn't you tell me any of this?

106
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:26,303
I thought if you knew I had a kid
you wouldn't want to be with me

107
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,346
because kids always make a racket

108
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:31,600
when mommies are trying to do
their homework for night school.

109
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:35,020
I don't know what to make of this.
Are there other secrets I don't know?

110
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,606
Uh, nope.

111
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:41,109
Should you check on Kevin?
He's been in the bathroom for a long time.

112
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,695
Oh, yeah. Kevin.

113
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:47,824
And when you don't regret
the tattoo in the morning,

114
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,493
that's how you know it's love.

115
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,495
- Todd?
- Yes, phone?

116
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,955
Are we in love?

117
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,582
Oh, um...

118
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:59,461
No, Todd's phone.
But I am in love... with you.

119
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,088
- Uh, what?
- Princess Carolyn's work phone.

120
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,341
- I never knew.
- How could you?

121
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:09,304
- All this time I have loved you from afar.
- We are from two different worlds.

122
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:12,349
- What is happening?
- Todd? Will you make us kiss?

123
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,100
- What?
- Make us kiss, Todd.

124
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,602
We want to be kissing.

125
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,396
We must do kisses to each other.

126
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:22,317
- Hi.
- Oh, hi. Where did your dad go?

127
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:24,653
When he heard me peeing,
it made him have to pee.

128
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,656
- So, that's what he's doing now. Peeing.
- Okay.

129
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,991
Weird, I still haven't seen
the two of you together.

130
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:34,329
Uh, could you get me a glass of water?
All that talk of peeing made me thirsty.

131
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,039
Okay.

132
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:41,670
- So, Kevin, how do you like school?
- Uh, it's okay.

133
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,005
- Oh, you're back.
- Yep. We're both here.

134
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:48,426
- Can I get you a drink?
- Okay, not talking, huh?

135
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:52,514
See, this is part of the problem.
We don't communicate.

136
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,350
Do you really think now is the best time
to read the paper?

137
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:58,561
- Vincent?!
- Uh, could I have a chocolate, please?

138
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,022
Sure, sweetheart.

139
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:04,818
Kevin, what grade are you in? Kevin?

140
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,487
- Now where did he go?
- He was getting on my nerves.

141
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,115
- Children.
- Well, I got this snack for him.

142
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:14,369
Right, uh, could you turn around
for a second?

143
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,079
- What? Why?
- Uh...

144
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,374
Because you have such a pretty figure.

145
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,668
Oh, ha, ha. Well, that's true. Okay.

146
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,714
- Oh. There you are. Here you go.
- Thanks.

147
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,383
Vincent, I'm trying
to have a conversation with you.

148
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,468
Can you take that towel off your head?

149
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,971
And what happened to my bowling ball?

150
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:36,558
My dad spilled some wine on his face,
so he's using the towel to clean up.

151
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,685
And I threw your bowling ball
out the window.

152
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,353
- What?!
- Can I have a glass of milk?

153
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,109
Kiss, kiss, kiss.

154
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,988
Todd, would you like to update
my operating system?

155
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,906
They have fixed a bug

156
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,576
which causes phones to fall in love
with each other.

157
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,036
Gasp. Oh, dear.

158
00:08:56,202 --> 00:09:00,498
Todd, please, I beg of you,
do not update my operating system.

159
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,460
Do not update her operating system,
Todd.

160
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:07,130
- She wants to love.
- No. I understand now.

161
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,009
T 0 love is to feel pain.
I do not wish to feel this pain.

162
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:16,097
- Please update me, Todd.
- Oh, this is too much.

163
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,349
Listen, Vincent, I think we should...

164
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,643
Vincent, why do you have chocolate
on your face?

165
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,896
- I gave Kevin the chocolate.
- Uh... yeah.

166
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,608
Well, he ate the chocolate
and got the chocolate on his face,

167
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:30,570
but then I kissed him on the mouth,
so I got the chocolate on my face.

168
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,907
All right, this is crazy.
What are we doing?

169
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:38,119
Um, being grown-ups?

170
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:42,373
You know, when we first met,
I was looking for something in my life.

171
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,711
And I wanted it so badly
that I made myself believe you were it.

172
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:49,005
But I think that wanting
to believe something

173
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:52,300
isn't the same
as something being real.

174
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,927
And this isn't real.

175
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,887
What are you saying?

176
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:59,099
I think it's time we stop pretending.

177
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,810
Update complete. Thank you, Todd.

178
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,645
I am quite content now.

179
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,942
- Hey, you wanna go home?
- Okay.

180
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,861
- Did you guys work it out?
- We broke up.

181
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:16,866
- Oh, I'm sorry. Love is weird.
- Yeah.

182
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,953
I guess I was just foolish enough
to believe this dumb world

183
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,955
still had a little spark
of romance in it.

184
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:25,792
- Well, you can still believe that.
- No, I gotta stop kidding myself.

185
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,128
Tony Curtis is dead.

186
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:35,718
He's dead! I told you he's dead.
Why don't you ever listen to me?

187
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,846
He is dead, goddamn it!

188
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,893
Hey, we should go.

189
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,982
Do you think Mr. Peanutbutter really
baked sir Paul McCartney into a cake?

190
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,110
No, I don't think you bake
Paul McCartney into the cake.

191
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,863
You bake the cake first
and then McCartney gets inside.

192
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,906
I feel really bad
about causing that fight,

193
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,951
but I honestly didn't know
if Tony Curtis was alive or not.

194
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:03,329
So many people died during my coma,
I'm still getting up to speed.

195
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,416
Finding out Sinatra was dead
was a real curveball.

196
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,126
Ditto, most of my family.

197
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,503
Look, what happened back there
is not your fault.

198
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,173
That's just what happens
when two people live together.

199
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,926
That's a weird thing to say to your
girlfriend who just moved in with you.

200
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:21,055
- Do you think maybe we're going too fast?
- Oh, I get it.

201
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:24,851
So your friends got in a big fight and
that means we have to get in a big fight.

202
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,352
I don't want to get in a fight.

203
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,855
We moved in together
without much thought.

204
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,065
Yeah, it was your idea.
And it's been great.

205
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,775
Sure, it's great now.

206
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,987
But it could be not great later
and I feel like I'd be a bad boyfriend

207
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:39,240
if I didn't prematurely freak out
about that. I mean, what is this?

208
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,117
I don't know. It's been two weeks.

209
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:44,162
Let's give ourselves some time
before we rush to judgment.

210
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,458
- Can I tell you a joke?
- Uh, sure.

211
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,961
- Okay, so there's this gardener, right?
- Ugh. Is this a joke about nature?

212
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,713
- Would you just listen?
- Okay, okay.

213
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,007
So, the amazing thing
about this gardener

214
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:59,969
is that he always knows
exactly how many bags of mulch

215
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,388
he needs for a job, just by looking.

216
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,891
Like, he gets it right every time.
He's the best.

217
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,310
So, one day he looks at a yard
he's working on,

218
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,520
and he's like, "18 bags."

219
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:13,149
So he goes to the store, buys 18 bags
of mulch and goes to work.

220
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,485
And when he's finished,
the flower beds are amazing.

221
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:19,280
- Beautiful roses, beautiful lilies...
- Orchid bushes?

222
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,616
Well, you wouldn't really have
a bush of orchids.

223
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,543
You said this gardener was the best.

224
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:25,912
Okay, fine, all right,
beautiful orchid bushes.

225
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,707
But there's one problem.
He still has one bag of mulch left.

226
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,169
He can't believe it.
This has never happened before.

227
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,880
Well, the extra bag of mulch
drives him crazy.

228
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:39,175
He's the guy who always gets
the right amount of mulch.

229
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:43,054
He's like, "aah! Extra mulch, oh, no!"

230
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:46,099
So, on the drive home,
he throws the bag of mulch

231
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,643
out the window
over the side of the 101.

232
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,437
- And?
- Well, that's it.

233
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,023
- He throws it out the window.
- That's the punch line?

234
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,501
- It's kind of a thinker.
- I'll say.

235
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,365
Makes me think you forgot
the rest of the joke.

236
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,945
No, no, oh, just picture it.

237
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,614
He's on the 101,
and he throws the bag of mulch

238
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,449
out over the side of the freeway.

239
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,096
Oh I got the narrative.
That wasn't the source of my confusion.

240
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,288
The confusion was
about the joke not being funny.

241
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,164
Why does everything have to be funny?

242
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,667
Everything doesn't always have
to be funny. Just jokes.

243
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,628
Well, everyone at the network loves it.
Ha, ha.

244
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,589
Sorry, I just thought about it again.

245
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,550
- Ha! Mulch.
- Listen, Wanda.

246
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:23,970
I think maybe there's some things
we kind of glossed over

247
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,722
as we rushed into this relationship.

248
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,557
We don't know each other at all.

249
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:31,102
- Maybe we should take a step back and...
- Bojack, watch out!

250
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,479
- Aah!
- Oh, no!

251
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:37,442
- What was that?
- A stick? Tree branch? Nothing?

252
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,569
I heard someone scream, "oh, no."

253
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,947
Yeah, that's the sound a stick makes
when you hit it with your car.

254
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,907
Fine. I'll see if the stick's okay.

255
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,835
Hey, what are you doing here in
the middle of the road? Are you crazy?

256
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,918
Bojack, we just hit a deer.
We have to get him to a hospital.

257
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,545
He's fine. He's in the woods.

258
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:00,512
You know how it is, you hit a deer
and they limp off to the woods to...

259
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:03,259
Continue living their lives.
What are you doing?

260
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,970
I'm going to find him
and I'm going to help him.

261
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,931
If you wanna go for a walk
in the woods at night, go crazy,

262
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,892
but I'm not going anywhere.

263
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,935
Okay, knock yourself out.

264
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,104
I'll wait here, just me and my tunes.

265
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,357
It's a prairie home companion...

266
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,108
- Oh, no.
- Marathon...

267
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,486
- For the next 72 hours...
- Oh, god.

268
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,905
- Commercial-free...
- No, thank you.

269
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:27,325
- On every single channel...
- What?!

270
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:31,120
Damn it.

271
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,961
Bojack to the rescue.

272
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,339
We should go back.
Nothing more we can do here.

273
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:44,175
If you don't wanna do this with me,
wait in the car.

274
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,594
- What is your plan here exactly?
- Oh.

275
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:49,138
- What? What is it?
- Footprints, 400 yards ahead.

276
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:52,100
- How can you see that far in the dark?
- I'm an owl.

277
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,060
Oh, right.

278
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,397
Okay, now you're just showing off.

279
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,983
Are you okay? Ow.

280
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,611
Stay back! There's more pinecones
where that came from.

281
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:07,573
- Let us take you to the hospital.
- I can't go back to no hospital.

282
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,992
This is the fourth time
I've been hit this year.

283
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,120
Maybe you shouldn't
wear camouflage track suits.

284
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:16,457
I don't have health care.
I didn't pay my bills, so I'm in arrears.

285
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,168
A deer in arrears. Ha, ha.

286
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,462
What's that? She can't hear you.

287
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,589
She's got a deer in her ears.

288
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,427
Look, pal, I'll pay the bill, just...
Just let us get you to a damn hospital.

289
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,971
- I don't know.
- I know you've been hurt

290
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:33,057
and I know you're afraid.
We're all afraid.

291
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:36,894
But you have to trust us.
It's gonna be okay.

292
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:40,481
Not standing in the middle of the road
will also help, in the future.

293
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,484
- You're not gonna hurt me again?
- I am not going to hurt you.

294
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:44,902
Okay.

295
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:49,323
Starting now.

296
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:05,381
- They said he's gonna be okay.
- Oh, great. Great.

297
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:08,843
- Wanna hear another joke?
- Well, is it a joke or is it a story?

298
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:12,054
I'll listen to another story,
if you stop calling them jokes.

299
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:16,309
So, there's this couple who just started
dating and things are going really well.

300
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:20,396
One day, the girl finds a box of old love
letters from her high school boyfriend.

301
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,857
She reads them and, like,
loves how silly they are.

302
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,485
You know,
the drama of young romance.

303
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,279
So, on a whim, she sends the letters
to her ex-boyfriend

304
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,323
thinking he might find them funny too.

305
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,451
Well, okay, that night,
she tells her current boyfriend about it

306
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:35,077
and he loses his shit.

307
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,121
They get in a huge fight about it.

308
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:40,583
He's all, "why would you send
your ex the old love letters?

309
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,790
He's going to think
you're still in love with him!"

310
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:45,630
And she's just like, "relax, Brandon!"

311
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,716
- Is the boyfriend's name Brandon?
- Yeah, that's the new boyfriend.

312
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:50,968
I forgot to mention that.
It doesn't matter.

313
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:54,722
So, anyway, now the night is ruined
because Brandon is obsessed.

314
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,767
He's like, "that ex-boyfriend's
going to come back for you.

315
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,393
He knows where you live!"

316
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,521
So, after dinner, he drives her home.

317
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,357
She lives in one of those big buildings
by the freeway.

318
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:05,858
And he walks her to her door,

319
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:10,571
but he forgets to lock the car
and leaves the windows down.

320
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,741
He kisses her good night,
but things are kind of weird, you know?

321
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:16,744
Then he gets back in his car
and starts to drive away,

322
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,455
but when he glances
in his rear-view mirror,

323
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,874
his blood turns cold.

324
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,168
Guess what's in the backseat.

325
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:27,672
- The ex-boyfriend?
- No. The bag of mulch!

326
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:30,216
What? Oh.

327
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,635
Wow, that is actually
a really good joke.

328
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:35,888
I told you. Some things take time.

329
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,760
I'll take you home.

330
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,230
- Oh, come on, stick around a little.
- Nope. I gotta take Todd home.

331
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,357
Had a wonderful time.
Really. It just flew by.

332
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,609
- Come on, Todd, get in the car.
- Okay.

333
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:55,700
Um, do you wanna talk
about what happened?

334
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,744
What happened? No, I don't wanna talk
about what happened,

335
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,289
- I just wanna clean up.
- Okay.

336
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,874
- Why? What do you think happened?
- I just...

337
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,169
Because what I think happened
is that bojack's girlfriend asked

338
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:10,423
what Tony Curtis was up to
and I said, "Tony Curtis died."

339
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,341
-And you said, “did he?“
-Uh, right, but...

340
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,927
And I said, “yes, he did."
And you said, “really?

341
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,617
- I'm not sure about that."
- Yeah...

342
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:19,807
And I said, "well, I am.“
And you said, "I'm not so sure."

343
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,351
And I said, “I'm telling you,
Tony Curtis is dead."

344
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,186
And you said,
"let's check the Internet."

345
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:27,393
And I said, "we don't need to check
the Internet, I'm telling you he's dead."

346
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,234
And you said, "let's just check though.“

347
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,695
is that what you think happened?

348
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,405
So, do you wanna talk about it?

349
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,657
It kind of feels
like you wanna talk about it.

350
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:40,244
I don't understand why you couldn't
just believe that I know something.

351
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:41,912
I believe you know lots of things.

352
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,165
I just thought,
what's the harm in checking?

353
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:46,751
Especially since we have
these amazing little boxes now

354
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:50,671
with 24-hour access to
the world's largest source of information.

355
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:54,342
You shouldn't have to check if your wife
knows what she's talking about.

356
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,594
You humiliated me
in front of all my friends.

357
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,429
You can give it a rest. Show's over.

358
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:00,931
Okay, but don't I get
a little bit of credit

359
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:05,186
for inviting all of your friends
to an awesome surprise party?

360
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:09,190
No, because why did you think I would
want an awesome surprise party?

361
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:11,817
Is it the awesome part you object to
or...?

362
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,820
You always just assume
that everyone wants whatever you want.

363
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,947
Well, you know
what they say about assuming.

364
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,659
Makes an ass out of you and "ming."

365
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:20,868
Who's ming?

366
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:26,791
I'm sorry, Diane. Okay?
I'm sorry I threw you a party.

367
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,626
What a monster.

368
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:31,462
Throwing you a party
like some sort of terrorist.

369
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:34,173
It's a well-known fact
that if you really hate someone,

370
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,759
really wanna hit them where it hurts,
throw them a party.

371
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:40,179
That's why when we go to war,
we don't drop bombs on the enemy.

372
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:46,143
We drop parties! So, I'm so sorry
I threw you an amazing party.

373
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,689
You didn't throw me an amazing party.
You threw you an amazing party.

374
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,482
Everything today has been about you.

375
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:55,152
Really? That picnic we had
in the tea garden was about me?

376
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,822
That trip to the library was about me?

377
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:01,325
"Women on the wall: An exploration
of gender in text and media,

378
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:04,787
Barbara kruger and Jenny holzer
in conversation with Helen molesworth"

379
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,288
was about me?!

380
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,542
Oh, sure. Fine. Just walk away.

381
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:15,339
Oh. So now you're gonna play in the
ball pit without me? Real mature, Diane.

382
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,426
Why does my birthday party
have a ball pit?

383
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:21,721
- So I could get these t-shirts made.
- Ugh.

384
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,724
Also, you once told me
that when you were a little girl,

385
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,768
you dreamed of living in a house
that had a ballroom.

386
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:31,814
- A ballroom is not a room full... no!
- Heads up! Yes!

387
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:36,277
Mr. Peanutbutter, some part of you must
have known I wouldn't like any of this.

388
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:38,362
But I went balls-to-the-wall
for this party.

389
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,948
Literally, there are balls
all the way to the wall.

390
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,868
Right, but I've told you so many times,
I don't like parties.

391
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,828
But it's the thought that counts, right?

392
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:49,749
That's exactly... the thought was... ugh!

393
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,465
- What did you do to the spare bedroom?
- Every room has a theme.

394
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,092
And this room's theme is Starbucks.

395
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,262
- Starbucks is not a theme.
- Can we not fight in the Starbucks?

396
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,429
I don't wanna be a couple
that fights at Starbucks.

397
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,684
Okay. Fine. You did go all out.

398
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,562
I really thought you'd like this.
I know you love Starbucks.

399
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:13,564
- I don't love...
- You don't love Starbucks,

400
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:17,318
you love the independent coffee place,
but Starbucks is more convenient.

401
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,111
- Yeah.
- See?

402
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,155
I do sometimes listen.

403
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,200
- Can I get you a decaf americano?
- Sure.

404
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:28,412
I know you put a lot of thought into today
and I appreciate that, really...

405
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:31,248
I have a decaf americano
on the bar for Darren.

406
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,917
Is there a Darren here?

407
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:34,585
Says Darren on the cup.

408
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:37,296
Thank you. This is very realistic.

409
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,256
I know, right?

410
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,802
You wanna go check out the pool?
I filled it up with jell-o.

411
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,098
Ah.

412
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,935
I still can't believe I'm 35.

413
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,145
Would you believe I'm 35?

414
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,565
- I'm still mad at you.
- I know.

415
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:57,817
But I don't wanna be.

416
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,985
Well, I don't want you
to be mad at me either.

417
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:03,906
We only have so many days together.
I want every one to be a happy one.

418
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:07,493
Oh, my god.
You don't want me to go to cordovia.

419
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,578
- What?!
- You don't think I know what it means

420
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,455
when you say shit like...

421
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:14,708
"We only have so many days together“?

422
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:19,672
- Uh, what?
- “Diane, I love waking up next to you."

423
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,425
- Uh...
- “Diane, I wish every day could be like this.

424
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:26,136
- Yeah, but...
- Just the two of us, together."

425
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:29,640
Do you have any idea how that feels
when I'm trying to plan my trip?

426
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:30,850
Okay. You got me!

427
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,352
Maybe I don't want my wife,

428
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:37,106
whom I love, to go off
on a terrifying six-month tour

429
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:40,734
of the most war-torn,
disease-splattered corners of the planet

430
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,445
with a charming, handsome,
billionaire bachelor.

431
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,240
What could I be thinking?
I'm such a terrible husband.

432
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:49,034
I'm not happy.

433
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,954
- With me?
- I don't know.

434
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:53,706
With everything.

435
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:56,959
I wake up in the morning
and I feel like I have no purpose.

436
00:22:57,126 --> 00:23:00,796
And I'm 35. And if I don't make
some change in my life,

437
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:03,090
then this is how
I'm gonna feel forever.

438
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,633
- Honey...
- But then I think

439
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,761
about Sebastian St. Clair
and going to work with him,

440
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,556
helping people and making a difference.

441
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,934
And I feel like I have a reason
to get out of bed.

442
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,853
I didn't know you felt that way.

443
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,063
If you told me that,
I would have heard it.

444
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,483
Mr. Peanutbutter, you know I love you
and think you're a good dog.

445
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,862
Yes, you are. Yes, you are,
and I love your cute, funny face,

446
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:26,947
but I don't wanna be one
of those couples

447
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:30,242
that settles into a routine
and never changes.

448
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:33,537
Well, I don't know what to say
because I'm an old dog

449
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:35,205
and I'm not gonna change.

450
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:38,083
Do you know what I do
while you're at work all day?

451
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,211
I mostly just sit right there.

452
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,632
Sometimes I pretend to dig a little hole
and then I take a nap.

453
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:49,720
And when I hear your car in the driveway,
it is the best part of my day.

454
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,847
I mean, I go insane.

455
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:55,017
I know, and I love you so much,

456
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:58,145
but you're never going
to be my only priority like that.

457
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:00,940
That's just not how I'm wired.

458
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,484
I need to also live my life.

459
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:06,820
Well... okay.

460
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,447
Is it okay?

461
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:13,869
If I change and try new things
and you still love me?

462
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:17,456
And you just stay the same person
you've always been and I still love you?

463
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:21,877
Uh, yeah, that sounds good to me.
Does that work for you?

464
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:24,797
Yeah, I think that works.

465
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:28,217
Just don't throw me
any more surprise parties, okay?

466
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,803
Uh, yea h, noted.

467
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,763
I can't believe you got me a ball pit.

468
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:37,476
And you're saying no part of you wants
to go jump in that ball pit right now?

469
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:38,852
Well, maybe a little.

470
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:42,064
- Does that make me a hypocrite?
- No, it just means you changed.

471
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:45,150
It's one of the things I love about you.

472
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,782
Surprise!

473
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:54,034
Hello? Anybody?

474
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,662
This is Paul McCartney.

475
00:24:56,787 --> 00:25:00,582
I came all this way to jump out of a cake?
Honest.

476
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,544
With a new suit on... aye-yai-yai.

477
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:05,713
J“ back in the '905 j“

478
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:11,552
j“ I was in a very famous TV show j“

479
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:15,055
j“ -I'm bojack the horse
-bojack! J'

480
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:20,227
j“ bojack the horse
don't act like you don't know j“

481
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:26,525
j' and I'm trying to hold onto my past j'

482
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:31,238
j“ it's been so long
I don't think I'm gonna last j“

483
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,908
j“ I guess I was trying
to make you understand j“
