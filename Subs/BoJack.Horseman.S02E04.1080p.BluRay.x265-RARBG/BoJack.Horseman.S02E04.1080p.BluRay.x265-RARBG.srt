00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:11,303
[Peanutbutter]
So, did you have a good birthday?

2
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,097
- It was an amazing birthday!
- I had a great day, too.

3
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:17,476
I wish every day could be like this.
Just the two of us, together.

4
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:18,936
Yeah? You weren't too bored

5
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:21,702
by "women on the wall: An exploration
of gender in text and media,

00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,655
Barbara kruger and Jenny holzer
in conversation with Helen molesworth“?

7
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:25,733
Are you kidding?

8
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:29,321
I loved "women on the wall: An
exploration of gender in text and media,

9
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:32,658
Barbara kruger and Jenny holzer
in conversation with Helen molesworth."

10
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,493
It combined my two favorite things:

11
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,621
Modern art
and people talking about modern art.

12
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:40,457
I loved everything about today.
Thank you.

13
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:42,834
- So, there's nothing else you want?
- No.

14
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,837
All I want is to get into bed,
listen to prairie home companion

15
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:48,090
and snuggle up
to my wonderful husband.

16
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:53,470
- You don't want anything else?
- No. Today was perfect.

17
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:59,434
- Any additional thing would be overkill.
- Okay. If you say so.

18
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,853
- [All] Surprise!
- Oh, my god.

19
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,314
Are you surprised?
Tell me you're surprised.

20
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,985
She's speechless.
Oh, we got her good, folks.

21
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:11,113
Now let's party!

22
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:11,465
He's dead! I told you he's dead.
Why don't you ever listen to me?

23
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,592
He is dead, goddamn it!

24
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,598
- Hey, we should go.
- No, don't leave.

25
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:20,974
There's so much party left.

26
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,934
Paul McCartney's
gonna jump out of a cake.

27
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,604
Sorry, Wanda and I have to get
to a prior engagement...

28
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,606
- Party.
- A prior engagement party.

29
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:31,318
Yeah, my cousin's name is prior,
and it's a party for his engagement.

30
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,528
Engagement,
so it's a prior engagement party.

31
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,175
- What?
- And we gotta get there early

32
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,325
- because of the. Si...
- The si... silent auction!

33
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,932
-Auction, yeah-
-[Peanutbutter] Okay.

34
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,789
To benefit berto eco's fight
against heart disease...

35
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:44,955
- Uh...
- Wareness.

36
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,958
His fight
against heart disease awareness.

37
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,086
- Gotta 90.
- Wait, bojack!

38
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:52,089
- No! You're my ride.
- Too late, Todd. Save yourself.

39
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,841
- I'll take you home.
- Come on, stick around a little.

40
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,679
Nope. I gotta take Todd home. Had
a wonderful time. Really. It just flew by.

41
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,014
- Come on, Todd, get in the car.
- [Todd] Okay.

42
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,977
- I give them three months.
- Well, what makes you say that?

43
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,730
Let me think about,
what was my first clue?

44
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,108
Ah! Remember that time
at Diane's birthday party

45
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,110
when they got
in that huge screaming match

46
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,404
over whether or not
Tony Curtis was dead?

47
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,323
- That was weird.
- I don't wanna start another fight,

48
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,576
- but is he dead?
- If Tony Curtis died, I think I'd know.

49
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,537
The man's a national treasure.

50
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,957
He's the one speck of romance
in this tainted cynical world.

51
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:31,920
- I'll say. His cereal is great! Look out!
- What?

52
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:33,630
[Both shouting then tires squeal]

53
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,131
Ooh!

54
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,467
- Vincent?
- Ooh.

55
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,345
- That kid looks just like my boyfriend.
- Does he?

56
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:41,906
[Carolyn]
I'd know that face anywhere.

57
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,891
Well, hey, people look
like people all the time.

58
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,686
A lot of folks say
that I look like octavia Spencer

59
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:51,565
or the prince of cordovia or that guy
from the guten bourbon ads.

60
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,609
How could I have been so stupid?
This is why he never invited me

61
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,987
to his house,
why I've never met any of his friends.

62
00:03:57,154 --> 00:04:00,407
- What are you saying?
- Vincent has a secret family.

63
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:05,579
That kid was his son.
The lady was his wife. Oh, I'm a fool.

64
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,832
- [Todd] Where are we going?
- I need a drink.

65
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:13,295
- Are you gonna take me home first?
- You better call me back, asshole.

66
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,130
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

67
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,382
It's like you're three different people.

68
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:20,635
- So, you're not gonna take me home first?
- Should I call him again?

69
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,888
I'm sure there's a simple explanation.

70
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,849
Ugh. No wonder he wears a trench coat
all the time.

71
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,517
It's because he's so sneaky.

72
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:28,435
[Doorbell rings]

73
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,103
[Boy] Princess Carolyn.

74
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,730
Oh, my god, that's him!

75
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:35,358
Quick, jump out the window, shimmy
down the drainpipe and wait in the car.

76
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,444
- What?
- Vincent has a terrible temper.

77
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,862
He throws tantrums.

78
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,990
If he finds you in my apartment,
who knows what he's capable of?

79
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:45,368
But, also, stay close,
because if he finds me alone,

80
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,370
who knows what he's capable of?

81
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,916
Fine. You're lucky I love shimmying.

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,044
- Looking young.
- [Todd] Aah!

83
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,756
-Huh?

84
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:02,511
My name's Kevin. I promise you,
there is an explanation for all this.

85
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,680
Nice to meet you, Kevin.
Where's your daddy?

86
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:10,310
He's, uh, looking for parking.
He'll be up in a minute.

87
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:15,398
- I have to pee.
- Okay, the bathroom is just back there.

88
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:21,655
Ah. Herb.

89
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,407
Oh, nope.

90
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:27,786
[Man on radio]
It's a prairie home companion.

91
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,706
Phone, I'm bored.

92
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,793
[Phone]
I am sorry to hear that, Todd.

93
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,711
How many ounces are in a barrel?

94
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:41,132
A barrel has 4032 fluid ounces.

95
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,385
Well, I'm out of questions.

96
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,554
Do you have any questions for me?

97
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,766
I do have a question, Todd.
What is love?

98
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,940
Well, well, well,
look what the me dragged in.

99
00:05:57,107 --> 00:06:00,569
Is it dragged or drug?
Either way, drop dead.

100
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,445
Princess Carolyn, listen.

101
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,824
Kevin is my son, but I'm divorced.

102
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,660
And Kevin is in the bathroom
and I'm standing right here,

103
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,580
so as you can see
we're clearly two different people:

104
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,748
One adult and one child.

105
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,918
- Okay, bye!
- Not so fast, cowboy.

106
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,421
I'm not a cowboy, I'm a cow-man.

107
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:22,382
- I'm a man-man.
- Why didn't you tell me any of this?

108
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:26,303
I thought if you knew I had a kid
you wouldn't want to be with me

109
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,346
because kids always make a racket

110
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:31,600
when mommies are trying to do
their homework for night school.

111
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:35,020
I don't know what to make of this.
Are there other secrets I don't know?

112
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,606
Uh, nope.

113
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:41,109
Should you check on Kevin?
He's been in the bathroom for a long time.

114
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,695
Oh, yeah. Kevin.

115
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:47,824
And when you don't regret
the tattoo in the morning,

116
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,493
that's how you know it's love.

117
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,495
- [Phone] Todd?
- Yes, phone?

118
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,955
Are we in love?

119
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,582
Oh, um...

120
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:59,461
[Phone 2] No, Todd's phone.
But I am in love... with you.

121
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,088
- Uh, what?
- Princess Carolyn's work phone.

122
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,341
- I never knew.
- How could you?

123
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:09,304
- All this time I have loved you from afar.
- We are from two different worlds.

124
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:12,349
- What is happening?
- Todd? Will you make us kiss?

125
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,100
- What?
- [Phone 1] Make us kiss, Todd.

126
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,602
We want to be kissing.

127
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,396
[Phone 2] We must do kisses
to each other.

128
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:22,317
- Hi.
- Oh, hi. Where did your dad go?

129
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:24,653
When he heard me peeing,
it made him have to pee.

130
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,656
- So, that's what he's doing now. Peeing.
- Okay.

131
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,991
Weird, I still haven't seen
the two of you together.

132
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:34,329
Uh, could you get me a glass of water?
All that talk of peeing made me thirsty.

133
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,039
Okay.

134
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,499
[Kevin grunting]

135
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:41,670
- So, Kevin, how do you like school?
- Uh, it's okay.

136
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,005
- Oh, you're back.
- Yep. We're both here.

137
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:48,426
- Can I get you a drink?
- Okay, not talking, huh?

138
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:52,514
See, this is part of the problem.
We don't communicate.

139
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,350
Do you really think now is the best time
to read the paper?

140
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:58,561
- Vincent?!
- Uh, could I have a chocolate, please?

141
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,022
Sure, sweetheart.

142
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:04,818
Kevin, what grade are you in? Kevin?

143
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,487
- Now where did he go?
- He was getting on my nerves.

144
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,115
- Children.
- Well, I got this snack for him.

145
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:14,369
Right, uh, could you turn around
for a second?

146
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,079
- What? Why?
- Uh...

147
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,374
Because you have such a pretty figure.

148
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,668
Oh, ha, ha. Well, that's true. Okay.

149
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,086
[Hums]

150
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,714
- Oh. There you are. Here you go.
- Thanks.

151
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,383
Vincent, I'm trying
to have a conversation with you.

152
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,468
Can you take that towel off your head?

153
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,971
And what happened to my bowling ball?

154
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:36,558
My dad spilled some wine on his face,
so he's using the towel to clean up.

155
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,685
And I threw your bowling ball
out the window.

156
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,353
- What?!
- Can I have a glass of milk?

157
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,688
[Groans]

158
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,109
[Both phones] Kiss, kiss, kiss.

159
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,359
[Phone beeps]

160
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,988
[Phone 1] Todd, would you like to update
my operating system?

161
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,906
They have fixed a bug

162
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,576
which causes phones to fall in love
with each other.

163
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,036
Gasp. Oh, dear.

164
00:08:56,202 --> 00:09:00,498
Todd, please, I beg of you,
do not update my operating system.

165
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,460
Do not update her operating system,
Todd.

166
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:07,130
- She wants to love.
- No. I understand now.

167
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,009
T 0 love is to feel pain.
I do not wish to feel this pain.

168
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:16,097
- Please update me, Todd.
- Oh, this is too much.

169
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,349
Listen, Vincent, I think we should...

170
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,643
Vincent, why do you have chocolate
on your face?

171
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,896
- I gave Kevin the chocolate.
- Uh... yeah.

172
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,608
Well, he ate the chocolate
and got the chocolate on his face,

173
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:30,570
but then I kissed him on the mouth,
so I got the chocolate on my face.

174
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,907
All right, this is crazy.
What are we doing?

175
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:38,119
Um, being grown-ups?

176
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:42,373
You know, when we first met,
I was looking for something in my life.

177
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,711
And I wanted it so badly
that I made myself believe you were it.

178
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:49,005
But I think that wanting
to believe something

179
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:52,300
isn't the same
as something being real.

180
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,927
And this isn't real.

181
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,887
What are you saying?

182
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:59,099
I think it's time we stop pretending.

183
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,810
Update complete. Thank you, Todd.

184
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,645
I am quite content now.

185
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,942
- Hey, you wanna go home?
- Okay.

186
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,861
- Did you guys work it out?
- We broke up.

187
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:16,866
- Oh, I'm sorry. Love is weird.
- Yeah.

188
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,953
I guess I was just foolish enough
to believe this dumb world

189
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,955
still had a little spark
of romance in it.

190
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:25,792
- Well, you can still believe that.
- No, I gotta stop kidding myself.

191
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,128
Tony Curtis is dead.

192
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:35,718
He's dead! I told you he's dead.
Why don't you ever listen to me?

193
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,846
He is dead, goddamn it!

194
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,893
Hey, we should go.

195
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,982
Do you think Mr. Peanutbutter really
baked sir Paul McCartney into a cake?

196
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,110
No, I don't think you bake
Paul McCartney into the cake.

197
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,863
You bake the cake first
and then McCartney gets inside.

198
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,906
I feel really bad
about causing that fight,

199
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,951
but I honestly didn't know
if Tony Curtis was alive or not.

200
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:03,329
So many people died during my coma,
I'm still getting up to speed.

201
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,416
Finding out Sinatra was dead
was a real curveball.

202
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,126
Ditto, most of my family.

203
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,503
Look, what happened back there
is not your fault.

204
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,173
That's just what happens
when two people live together.

205
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,926
That's a weird thing to say to your
girlfriend who just moved in with you.

206
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:21,055
- Do you think maybe we're going too fast?
- Oh, I get it.

207
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:24,851
So your friends got in a big fight and
that means we have to get in a big fight.

208
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,352
I don't want to get in a fight.

209
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,855
We moved in together
without much thought.

210
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,065
Yeah, it was your idea.
And it's been great.

211
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,775
Sure, it's great now.

212
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,987
But it could be not great later
and I feel like I'd be a bad boyfriend

213
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:39,240
if I didn't prematurely freak out
about that. I mean, what is this?

214
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,117
I don't know. It's been two weeks.

215
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:44,162
Let's give ourselves some time
before we rush to judgment.

216
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,458
- Can I tell you a joke?
- Uh, sure.

217
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,961
- Okay, so there's this gardener, right?
- Ugh. Is this a joke about nature?

218
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,713
- Would you just listen?
- Okay, okay.

219
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,007
So, the amazing thing
about this gardener

220
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:59,969
is that he always knows
exactly how many bags of mulch

221
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,388
he needs for a job, just by looking.

222
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,891
Like, he gets it right every time.
He's the best.

223
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,310
So, one day he looks at a yard
he's working on,

224
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,520
and he's like, "18 bags."

225
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:13,149
So he goes to the store, buys 18 bags
of mulch and goes to work.

226
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,485
And when he's finished,
the flower beds are amazing.

227
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:19,280
- Beautiful roses, beautiful lilies...
- Orchid bushes?

228
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,616
Well, you wouldn't really have
a bush of orchids.

229
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,543
[Bojack]
You said this gardener was the best.

230
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:25,912
[Wanda] Okay, fine, all right,
beautiful orchid bushes.

231
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,707
But there's one problem.
He still has one bag of mulch left.

232
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,169
He can't believe it.
This has never happened before.

233
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,880
Well, the extra bag of mulch
drives him crazy.

234
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:39,175
He's the guy who always gets
the right amount of mulch.

235
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:43,054
He's like, "aah! Extra mulch, oh, no!"

236
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:46,099
So, on the drive home,
he throws the bag of mulch

237
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,643
out the window
over the side of the 101.

238
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,437
- And?
- Well, that's it.

239
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,023
- He throws it out the window.
- That's the punch line?

240
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,501
- It's kind of a thinker.
- I'll say.

241
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,365
Makes me think you forgot
the rest of the joke.

242
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,945
No, no, oh, just picture it.

243
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,614
He's on the 101,
and he throws the bag of mulch

244
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,449
out over the side of the freeway.

245
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,096
Oh I got the narrative.
That wasn't the source of my confusion.

246
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,288
The confusion was
about the joke not being funny.

247
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,164
Why does everything have to be funny?

248
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,667
Everything doesn't always have
to be funny. Just jokes.

249
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,628
Well, everyone at the network loves it.
Ha, ha.

250
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,589
Sorry, I just thought about it again.

251
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,550
- Ha! Mulch.
- Listen, Wanda.

252
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:23,970
I think maybe there's some things
we kind of glossed over

253
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,722
as we rushed into this relationship.

254
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,557
We don't know each other at all.

255
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:31,102
- Maybe we should take a step back and...
- Bojack, watch out!

256
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,479
- [Both] Aah!
- Oh, no!

257
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:37,442
- What was that?
- A stick? Tree branch? Nothing?

258
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,569
I heard someone scream, "oh, no."

259
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,947
Yeah, that's the sound a stick makes
when you hit it with your car.

260
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,907
Fine. I'll see if the stick's okay.

261
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,720
Hey, what are you doing here in
the middle of the road? Are you crazy?

262
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,120
[Groaning and grunting]

263
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,918
Bojack, we just hit a deer.
We have to get him to a hospital.

264
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,545
He's fine. He's in the woods.

265
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:00,512
You know how it is, you hit a deer
and they limp off to the woods to...

266
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:03,259
Continue living their lives.
What are you doing?

267
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,970
I'm going to find him
and I'm going to help him.

268
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,931
If you wanna go for a walk
in the woods at night, go crazy,

269
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,892
but I'm not going anywhere.

270
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,935
Okay, knock yourself out.

271
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,104
I'll wait here, just me and my tunes.

- For the next 72 hours...
- Oh, god.

Bojack to the rescue.

281
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,339
We should go back.
Nothing more we can do here.

If you don't wanna do this with me,
wait in the car.

283
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,594
- What is your plan here exactly?
- Oh.

284
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:49,138
- What? What is it?
- Footprints, 400 yards ahead.

where that came from.

So, there's this couple who just started
dating and things are going really well.

One day, the girl finds a box of old love
letters from her high school boyfriend.

She reads them and, like,
loves how silly they are.

You know,
the drama of young romance.

So, on a whim, she sends the letters
to her ex-boyfriend

314

thinking he might find them funny too.

315

Well, okay, that night,
she tells her current boyfriend about it

316

and he loses his shit.

your ex the old love letters?

you're still in love with him!"

- Yeah, that's the new boyfriend.

So, anyway, now the night is ruined
because Brandon is obsessed.

324
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,767
He's like, "that ex-boyfriend's
going to come back for you.

325
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,393
He knows where you live!"

326
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,521
So, after dinner, he drives her home.

327
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,357
She lives in one of those big buildings
by the freeway.

328
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:05,858
And he walks her to her door,

329
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:10,571
but he forgets to lock the car
and leaves the windows down.

330
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,741
He kisses her good night,
but things are kind of weird, you know?

331
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:16,744
Then he gets back in his car
and starts to drive away,

332
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,455
but when he glances
in his rear-view mirror,

333
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,874
his blood turns cold.

334
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,168
Guess what's in the backseat.

335
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:27,672
- The ex-boyfriend?
- No. The bag of mulch!

336
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:30,216
What? Oh.

337
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,635
Wow, that is actually
a really good joke.

338
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:35,888
I told you. Some things take time.

339
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,760
[Carolyn] I'll take you home.

340
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,230
- Oh, come on, stick around a little.
- Nope. I gotta take Todd home.

341
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,357
Had a wonderful time.
Really. It just flew by.

342
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,609
- Come on, Todd, get in the car.
- [Todd] Okay.

343
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:50,778
[Mumbling]

344
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:55,700
Um, do you wanna talk
about what happened?

345
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,744
What happened? No, I don't wanna talk
about what happened,

346
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,289
- I just wanna clean up.
- Okay.

347
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,874
- Why? What do you think happened?
- I just...

348
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,169
Because what I think happened
is that bojack's girlfriend asked

349
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:10,423
what Tony Curtis was up to
and I said, "Tony Curtis died."

350
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,341
-And you said, “did he?“
-Uh, right, but...

351
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,927
And I said, “yes, he did."
And you said, “really?

352
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,617
- I'm not sure about that."
- Yeah...

353
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:19,807
And I said, "well, I am.“
And you said, "I'm not so sure."

354
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,351
And I said, “I'm telling you,
Tony Curtis is dead."

355
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,186
And you said,
"let's check the Internet."

356
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:27,393
And I said, "we don't need to check
the Internet, I'm telling you he's dead."

357
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,234
And you said, "let's just check though.“

358
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,695
is that what you think happened?

359
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,405
So, do you wanna talk about it?

360
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,657
It kind of feels
like you wanna talk about it.

361
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:40,244
I don't understand why you couldn't
just believe that I know something.

362
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:41,912
I believe you know lots of things.

363
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,165
I just thought,
what's the harm in checking?

364
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:46,751
Especially since we have
these amazing little boxes now

365
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:50,671
with 24-hour access to
the world's largest source of information.

366
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:54,342
You shouldn't have to check if your wife
knows what she's talking about.

367
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,594
You humiliated me
in front of all my friends.

368
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,429
You can give it a rest. Show's over.

369
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:00,931
Okay, but don't I get
a little bit of credit

370
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:05,186
for inviting all of your friends
to an awesome surprise party?

371
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:09,190
No, because why did you think I would
want an awesome surprise party?

372
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:11,817
Is it the awesome part you object to
or...?

373
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,820
You always just assume
that everyone wants whatever you want.

374
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,947
Well, you know
what they say about assuming.

375
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,659
Makes an ass out of you and "ming."

376
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:20,868
Who's ming?

377
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:22,411
[Grunts]

378
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:26,791
I'm sorry, Diane. Okay?
I'm sorry I threw you a party.

379
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,626
What a monster.

380
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:31,462
Throwing you a party
like some sort of terrorist.

381
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:34,173
It's a well-known fact
that if you really hate someone,

382
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,759
really wanna hit them where it hurts,
throw them a party.

383
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:40,179
That's why when we go to war,
we don't drop bombs on the enemy.

384
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:46,143
We drop parties! So, I'm so sorry
I threw you an amazing party.

385
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,689
You didn't throw me an amazing party.
You threw you an amazing party.

386
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,482
Everything today has been about you.

387
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:55,152
Really? That picnic we had
in the tea garden was about me?

388
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,822
That trip to the library was about me?

389
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:01,325
"Women on the wall: An exploration
of gender in text and media,

390
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:04,787
Barbara kruger and Jenny holzer
in conversation with Helen molesworth"

391
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,288
was about me?!

392
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,542
Oh, sure. Fine. Just walk away.

393
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:10,917
[Shouts]

394
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:15,339
Oh. So now you're gonna play in the
ball pit without me? Real mature, Diane.

395
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,426
Why does my birthday party
have a ball pit?

396
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:21,721
- So I could get these t-shirts made.
- Ugh.

397
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,724
Also, you once told me
that when you were a little girl,

398
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,768
you dreamed of living in a house
that had a ballroom.

399
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:31,814
- A ballroom is not a room full... no!
- Heads up! Yes!

400
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:36,277
Mr. Peanutbutter, some part of you must
have known I wouldn't like any of this.

401
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:38,362
But I went balls-to-the-wall
for this party.

402
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,948
Literally, there are balls
all the way to the wall.

403
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,868
Right, but I've told you so many times,
I don't like parties.

404
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,828
But it's the thought that counts, right?

405
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:49,749
That's exactly... the thought was... ugh!

406
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,465
- What did you do to the spare bedroom?
- Every room has a theme.

407
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,092
And this room's theme is Starbucks.

408
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,262
- Starbucks is not a theme.
- Can we not fight in the Starbucks?

409
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,429
I don't wanna be a couple
that fights at Starbucks.

410
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,684
Okay. Fine. You did go all out.

411
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,562
I really thought you'd like this.
I know you love Starbucks.

412
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:13,564
- I don't love...
- You don't love Starbucks,

413
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:17,318
you love the independent coffee place,
but Starbucks is more convenient.

414
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,111
- Yeah.
- See?

415
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,155
I do sometimes listen.

416
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,200
- Can I get you a decaf americano?
- Sure.

417
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:28,412
I know you put a lot of thought into today
and I appreciate that, really...

418
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:31,248
I have a decaf americano
on the bar for Darren.

419
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,917
Is there a Darren here?

420
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:34,585
Says Darren on the cup.

421
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:37,296
Thank you. This is very realistic.

422
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,256
I know, right?

423
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,802
You wanna go check out the pool?
I filled it up with jell-o.

424
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,098
[Diane] Ah.

425
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,935
I still can't believe I'm 35.

426
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,145
Would you believe I'm 35?

427
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,565
- I'm still mad at you.
- I know.

428
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:57,817
But I don't wanna be.

429
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,985
Well, I don't want you
to be mad at me either.

430
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:03,906
We only have so many days together.
I want every one to be a happy one.

431
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:07,493
Oh, my god.
You don't want me to go to cordovia.

432
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,578
- What?!
- You don't think I know what it means

433
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,455
when you say shit like...

434
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:14,708
"We only have so many days together“?

435
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:19,672
- Uh, what?
- “Diane, I love waking up next to you."

436
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,425
- Uh...
- “Diane, I wish every day could be like this.

437
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:26,136
- Yeah, but...
- Just the two of us, together."

438
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:29,640
Do you have any idea how that feels
when I'm trying to plan my trip?

439
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:30,850
Okay. You got me!

440
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,352
Maybe I don't want my wife,

441
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:37,106
whom I love, to go off
on a terrifying six-month tour

442
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:40,734
of the most war-torn,
disease-splattered corners of the planet

443
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,445
with a charming, handsome,
billionaire bachelor.

444
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,240
What could I be thinking?
I'm such a terrible husband.

445
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:49,034
I'm not happy.

446
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,954
- With me?
- I don't know.

447
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:53,706
With everything.

448
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:56,959
I wake up in the morning
and I feel like I have no purpose.

449
00:22:57,126 --> 00:23:00,796
And I'm 35. And if I don't make
some change in my life,

450
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:03,090
then this is how
I'm gonna feel forever.

451
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,633
- Honey...
- But then I think

452
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,761
about Sebastian St. Clair
and going to work with him,

453
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,556
helping people and making a difference.

454
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,934
And I feel like I have a reason
to get out of bed.

455
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,853
I didn't know you felt that way.

456
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,063
If you told me that,
I would have heard it.

457
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,483
Mr. Peanutbutter, you know I love you
and think you're a good dog.

458
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,862
Yes, you are. Yes, you are,
and I love your cute, funny face,

459
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:26,947
but I don't wanna be one
of those couples

460
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:30,242
that settles into a routine
and never changes.

461
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:33,537
Well, I don't know what to say
because I'm an old dog

462
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:35,205
and I'm not gonna change.

463
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:38,083
Do you know what I do
while you're at work all day?

464
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,211
I mostly just sit right there.

465
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,632
Sometimes I pretend to dig a little hole
and then I take a nap.

466
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:49,720
And when I hear your car in the driveway,
it is the best part of my day.

467
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,847
I mean, I go insane.

468
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:55,017
I know, and I love you so much,

469
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:58,145
but you're never going
to be my only priority like that.

470
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:00,940
That's just not how I'm wired.

471
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,484
I need to also live my life.

472
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:06,820
Well... okay.

473
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,447
Is it okay?

474
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:13,869
If I change and try new things
and you still love me?

475
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:17,456
And you just stay the same person
you've always been and I still love you?

476
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:21,877
Uh, yeah, that sounds good to me.
Does that work for you?

477
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:24,797
Yeah, I think that works.

478
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:28,217
Just don't throw me
any more surprise parties, okay?

479
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,803
Uh, yea h, noted.

480
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,763
I can't believe you got me a ball pit.

481
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:37,476
And you're saying no part of you wants
to go jump in that ball pit right now?

482
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:38,852
[Diane] Well, maybe a little.

483
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:42,064
