1
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,558
Look alive, bright eyes.

2
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:19,186
It's the morning and somebody loves you.

3
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:20,687
Right back at you, buddy.

4
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,523
- Oh, my god. He's here.
- There he is.

5
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:26,318
- I love you, Mr. Peanutbutter.
- I love you, too.

6
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:31,657
Idea for a new pixar movie,
what are pizza boxes thinking about?

7
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:34,535
- And Leland Stanford?
- Transcontinental railroad.

8
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,620
- Transcontinental railroad?
- That is correct.

9
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:41,041
Next question,
what is my favorite kind of Berry?

10
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,377
- Barry bostwick.
- Raspberry?

11
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:46,380
I'm so sorry, the correct answer,
of course, was Barry bostwick.

12
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:49,132
- How was I supposed to know?
- He also likes franken Berry.

13
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,385
- We would have accepted franken Berry.
- What?

14
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,679
- I'm sorry, you lose.
- What the...?

15
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:57,099
That's our show but before we go
I wanna send out a quick message.

16
00:00:57,266 --> 00:01:03,105
Diane, if you're watching this, I love you
and I know you're doing great things.

17
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:08,652
Idea for a new app, an undo button
that could undo long amounts of time.

18
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:15,367
- Hey, is everyone having a good time? Ha!
- Three months. A year. A life.

19
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:20,455
Erica, where did that tooth come from?
All right, let's keep this party going.

20
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:24,167
One click and everything could
just go back to the way it was.

21
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:31,592
- Hey.
- Hey.

22
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:36,597
- You're still here?
- Yup. Still here.

23
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,451
- Stop it.
- Wake up, captain dumbshit.

24
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:42,329
I've been trying to get in touch
with you for two months.

25
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:47,376
Ow. Okay. I'm awake, I'm awake.
Aah! What is it?

26
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:52,422
If the studio wants to sue me, tell them
to take my house. I belong to the sea now.

27
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:56,134
- Are you drunk?
- Only on adventure. And gin.

28
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,636
And vodka. And gin.

29
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:00,472
They're not gonna sue you.
They finished the movie.

30
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,393
- What? How? Explain yourself, land wench.
- I don't know, ask turteltaub.

31
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:07,437
That's not why I'm here.
I thought you were in cordovia.

32
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,147
You've been here this whole time?

33
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:13,777
Idea for a thing Princess Carolyn
should do. Shut up.

34
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:15,612
Get dressed.
We're going to the orphanage.

35
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:16,779
- Huh?
- What orphanage?

36
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,741
Remember at herb's funeral,
I asked you what you wanted me to do

37
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:23,161
- with your horsin'around residuals?
- I do not remember that.

38
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,455
You said, "give it to an orphanage
or something."

39
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,958
- What?
- It turns out you made enough money

40
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,504
to build a brand new one.
So congratulations. You're a hero.

41
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:34,214
A hero?

42
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,925
That's right, a hero.

43
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,469
Or is it pronounced â€œgyro?"
I just call them subs.

44
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,681
Anyway, enjoy the sandwich,
you're a great man.

45
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,809
Welcome to
the bojack horseman orphanage.

46
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,729
Or, as we call it,
the bojack horsephanage.

47
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,397
You cannot call it that.

48
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:55,235
A, because I am not a great man and b,
because that is a really stupid name.

49
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:59,322
- The name was Molly's idea.
- Stop pissing off the orphans.

50
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,908
A lot of them grow up
to be serial killers.

51
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:06,329
Bojack's a very kind fellow
bojack's a very kind fellow

52
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,291
bojack's a very kind fellow

53
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:16,381
he gave us a place to live

54
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:19,885
thank you for that lovely song.
But I'm not a good person.

55
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:23,472
This is the only good thing I've ever done
and I did it by accident.

56
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,391
And it just goes to show you
life is just... ah, what am I saying?

57
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:30,270
I don't have to tell you how hard life is.
You're the ones with the dead parents.

58
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,315
- My parents are dead?
- No. No. Not necessarily.

59
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:35,358
Maybe they just didn't want you.

60
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:39,529
My point is,
I don't understand how people live.

61
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,865
It's amazing to me that people
wake up every morning

62
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:46,703
and say, "yeah, another day, let's do it."
How do people do it?

63
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,038
I don't know how.

64
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,415
Yay.

65
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:02,761
So you see, Todd, the nimble improviser
must navigate the most sensitive of areas.

66
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,555
- And I'm not just talking about the butt.
- Ha.

67
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:09,726
Copernicus, how do you always come
up with these amazing butt jokes?

68
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:14,105
When you're a level nine, as I am,
you don't come up with butt jokes.

69
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:18,401
You live truthfully in the moment
and the butt joke comes to you.

70
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,445
So true. So wise.

71
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:23,615
Listen, I need to "shove off,"
as we sailors say,

72
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:27,536
on my comedy cruise line the giggleship.
I shan't be returning.

73
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:28,870
- Shan't you?
- I shannot.

74
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:32,582
I'd like you to join me on the high seas,
as my number two

75
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,502
and I don't mean that kind of number two.

76
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,630
What, number two, how do you do that?

77
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:44,636
If it isn't the fershluginner putz
who cost me 50 grand.

78
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:47,889
I'm sorry I bailed in the middle of
production. If there's anything I can do.

79
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,808
Do? What do? Movie's finished.

80
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,977
- We fixed the whole thing in post.
- Really?

81
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:55,647
Remember your first week, these nerds
made a computer scan of your head

82
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,566
so we could finish
if something happened?

83
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,025
Please don't call us nerds, sir.

84
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,112
Something happened to you
so these nerds finished the movie.

85
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,698
Look what computer bojack can do.

86
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,617
- Help you out of that tree, ma'am?
- Look at him save that cat.

87
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,661
Now there's a protagonist
we can root for.

88
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,955
- You did all that in the computer?
- Not just that.

89
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:16,626
Computer bojack had so much charisma
and screen presence we ended up going back

90
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,713
- and replacing you in every scene.
- I'm not in the movie at all?

91
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,550
Ah, not technically, but computer you
is giving the performance of your career.

92
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,552
When people see what you do in this movie,

93
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,679
they are gonna storm
Daniel day-Lewis's house,

94
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,348
shlep him out into the street,
shoot him in the head.

95
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,017
That's how good your performance is.

96
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,394
It's gonna make Daniel day-Lewis
look like shit.

97
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,689
- They're gonna hate Daniel day-Lewis.
- But it's not my performance.

98
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:41,401
Explain that the widow day-Lewis.
She'll be devastated. Kaput. Kaplechshky.

99
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:44,654
Are you Jewish? Because I feel
some of these you're just making up.

100
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,656
We got a screening this weekend.

101
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,784
Come see the movie,
we'll shmooze, we'll kibbitz,

102
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,120
shlemiel shlimazel hasenpfeffer
incorporated.

103
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:58,543
Just think, Carolyn,
in one week, all of this will be ours.

104
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,046
We should a put a social-media desk there.

105
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,965
If we hire someone to micromanage
our clients' online personas

106
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,093
and new media outreach, they'll seem
more grounded down to earth.

107
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,013
Smiling poop emoji,
I love everything about that.

108
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,767
I wanna make sure the couches
we get are really comfortable.

109
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:17,896
- Just in case we have some late nights.
- Mr. Rabitowitz.

110
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,523
This is a place of business.

111
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,568
Ugh, can we just freeze in this moment
for a second?

112
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,863
I just wanna remember this instant
where for once in my life,

113
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,907
- everything was going...
- Hold that thought.

114
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,074
What is it?

115
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,116
Ugh. My wife and I are going
to the ballet tonight,

116
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,995
there's a real ish
with the restaurant.

117
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,040
- This is the wife you're divorcing, right?
- You know how it is.

118
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:40,460
You say you want a divorce
and she says, "no, we can make this work."

119
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,213
You go to counseling and
remember why you fell in love with her

120
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,858
in the first place
and then, blah, blah, it's a whole thing.

121
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,884
We've been sleeping together
for three months.

122
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:51,680
- We're about to start a company together.
- None of that has to change.

123
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:55,600
I am definitely going to divorce
her probably, it's just...

124
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:58,436
Ugh. It's hard to explain to someone
who's never been married.

125
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,771
- Listen, this is...
- Oh!

126
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,898
Sorry, Katie just said something funny.

127
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:05,026
- What?
- I gotta hop. I love you though.

128
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:14,661
Ha, ha. Okay, keep the engine running,
I'll be back in a... oh.

129
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,122
- Hey.
- Hey.

130
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:21,001
Um, I'm just here to pick up some stuff.
I'm going away for a while.

131
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,545
- Oh, where?
- The giggleship.

132
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:26,006
It's the comedy cruise line
people magazine

133
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:30,218
- once called a comedy cruise line.
- Comedy cruise line?

134
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,597
Oh right, your improv thing.
How was your, uh, graduation show?

135
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:38,143
- It was two months ago. You missed it.
- Sorry.

136
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,644
- No you're not.
- Well...

137
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:44,315
Hey, do you remember the morning
after my first night here?

138
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:47,652
I don't know why everyone keeps asking
if I remember things. I don't.

139
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,739
Just as a general rule,
if your question begins, "do you remember"

140
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:54,117
and doesn't end with "how much you hated
Moulin Rouge," the answer's no.

141
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:58,038
I was so happy to have a place
to stay that I made pancakes.

142
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,498
And you kept eating them
so I kept making them.

143
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:04,002
And then you got mad at me
for letting you eat so many pancakes.

144
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:07,047
You tried to chase me around the pool,
but you were too hungover

145
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:12,010
and also full from the pancakes
so instead you took a nap.

146
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:17,015
And when you woke up, you said,
"thanks for the pancakes.

147
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:20,685
- Now get out of my house."
- I don't remember any of that.

148
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:25,190
Well, anyway, I'm finally moving out,
just like you wanted.

149
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:28,359
Good. Honestly you'll probably
be better off without me.

150
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:33,823
Yeah. But we had some good times though,
right?

151
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:38,870
- Did we?
- Right. Well, uh, take care.

152
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:42,624
Hey, I hope you can find a way
to be happy, bojack.

153
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:46,086
- I really do.
- Yeah, okay.

154
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,088
Hey, Todd?

155
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,635
You need to get your shit together.

156
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:57,555
- Ugh.
- Rutabaga and I are starting a new agency.

157
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,975
I want you to come on board
and write celebrity tweets.

158
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,561
- I don't know how to do that.
- You're a ghost-writer.

159
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,773
It's the same as writing a book,
they're just a lot shorter

160
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,191
and more people read them.

161
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:11,236
All right, but why are you helping me?

162
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,864
Because my life is a mess right now and I
compulsively take care of other people

163
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,791
when I don't know how
to take care of myself.

164
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,036
Oh. I was hoping it was
because you believed in me.

165
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,203
I don't.

166
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,793
Welcome to my giggleship.

167
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,380
For us, it's a place to realize
our higher selves. For the paying public,

168
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:34,592
it's a place to watch improv and drink
watered-down margaritas for 8.99.

169
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,637
Wow, we must all make a lot of money.

170
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:42,058
No, no, you just get paid
in experience and stage time.

171
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:45,895
- Which in a way is even better than money.
- Say what?

172
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,189
Look, we've arrived
at your living quarters.

173
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:54,737
Wow. No more couch sleeping for this guy.
He gets a mattress.

174
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:55,904
That's the spirit.

175
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:59,117
And you can use improv to make
this room anything you want it to be.

176
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:02,954
My cabin is exactly like yours,
but when I use my imagination,

177
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:06,624
it becomes a rich stateroom
with a treasure chest full of Booty.

178
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:10,336
I like a big Booty, if you know what
I mean and I don't mean a butt.

179
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,759
You really are the master
of spontaneous witticisms.

180
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:24,267
All right, you ready? This is go time.
There's no turning back now.

181
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,144
- Oh, I am ready.
- Great.

182
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:30,064
Now let's get out there and tell all those
garbage rat bastard sons of bastards

183
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,734
what we really think of them,
once and for all.

184
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:35,153
Everyone. We have an announcement.

185
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,197
Guys, we have an announcement.

186
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,491
- What's going on?
- Mr. Witherspoon's in the hospital.

187
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:43,077
- He had a stroke.
- Oh.

188
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,080
Well, you know what you rat bastards
can stroke?

189
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,291
- Uh... oh.
- My big, hairy...

190
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,295
Well, we burned that bridge.

191
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:02,138
Todd, you should be up a magician's
sleeve because you are a card.

192
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:06,184
Hey, Bryan. What's going on here?

193
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:09,354
- He refused to scrub the floors.
- Oh, Bryan.

194
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,273
Please. My knees were cramping
so I needed to stand.

195
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,402
But I'm real good at cleaning windows.
Look.

196
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:20,406
That's solid space-work.
Bryan, don't worry.

197
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,992
I'm gonna go to copernicus
and get this sorted out.

198
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:27,830
Copernicus? Uh, copernicus?

199
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,332
Huh?

200
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,130
Whoa.

201
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,804
One hundred and one butt jokes?

202
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:47,308
"No parking in the rear?" Ha, ha. Aah!

203
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:51,521
- Copernicus is a fraud.
- A fraud? Me? Ow.

204
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:54,315
- Aah.
- I had such high hopes for you, Todd.

205
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,985
Normally I'd make a perfectly
timed butt joke here,

206
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,904
but as you can see,
I don't have my book.

207
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:02,365
- Oh!
- Guards, take this subversive

208
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,200
to the yes and room.

209
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:07,078
No. Hey, what are you doing?

210
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:11,874
No. Shame on all of you! Just wait
till you see my trip advisor review.

211
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,210
This cruise is getting three stars.

212
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:18,089
Because I have very
mixed feelings about it.

213
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:24,429
- Carolyn, we are free.
- Yeah.

214
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,764
Real quick, kiss me once.
Then kiss me twice.

215
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,808
I don't want to do that anymore.

216
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:32,103
- I told you we can make this work...
- No. I don't want...

217
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,814
Carolyn, you're a single woman
in your 405.

218
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,108
- Can you really afford to be picky?
- What?

219
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:40,903
I'm just saying, what, you think you're
gonna find some perfect unattached guy

220
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,572
who's gonna love you like I do?

221
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,283
Who's gonna make you laugh
and feel good about yourself?

222
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,327
This is it, Carolyn, this is what you get.

223
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,412
If you're holding out
for something better,

224
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:53,041
well, I hate to break it to you, but
you're gonna be alone for a long time.

225
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,544
I'm not afraid of being alone.

226
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,464
And you might wanna find
some place else to work

227
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:03,051
- because you're not coming with me.
- Wait, wait, wait, what?

228
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,511
It's my company.
My name is on all the paperwork.

229
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,181
I think I can do it without you.
Good luck.

230
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:14,479
- Whoa, Carolyn, we just... come, Carolyn.
- My name is Princess Carolyn.

231
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,983
And as I held
that baby in my arms,

232
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,486
I knew I had been given a second chance.

233
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:27,158
A chance to finally make things right.
And this time I was gonna win

234
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,077
the race of life.

235
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:38,044
- Whoa. That was actually good.
- We're doing a full awards push.

236
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,296
You should clear your schedule
for the next year.

237
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,632
Buckle up, buddy,
this is the year of secretariat.

238
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:46,844
But it wasn't secretariat.
And it wasn't me. It was a computer.

239
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,597
What difference does it make?
Smile and collect your trophies.

240
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,241
- You know Ana spanikopita?
- Hello.

241
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,976
- Aah!
- They call her the Oscar whisperer.

242
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,646
- Ana spanikopita. Big fan.
- Thank you, it's...

243
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,273
I meant you are going to be
a big fan of me

244
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,651
because I am going
to win you an Oscar.

245
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:02,985
Ana is the best there is.

246
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,340
- You better start writing your speech.
- I don't have to thank my parents, do I?

247
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:09,117
You're funny.
I am literally laughing out loud.

248
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,923
- Uh...
- We gotta get you on a talk show.

249
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,663
You have any weird history
with Kelly ripa I should know about?

250
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:17,250
- No. Well, define "weird."
- You look doughy. Do you run?

251
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,961
- Cardio? Anything?
- I mean, occasionally.

252
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:23,423
Excuse me?
That was such a beautiful performance.

253
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,550
- So brave.
- Thank you.

254
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,969
Everyone here loves you.
Do you feel that?

255
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,887
- Feel that energy?
- They don't love me.

256
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,223
- They don't know me.
- That's why they love you.

257
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:36,060
He's right. Our research shows
america likes to think they know you

258
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:39,188
and then they like learning more
about you, but at a certain point

259
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:43,568
they pass a threshold where they actually
know you and then they find you weird

260
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:44,944
and offputting.

261
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:48,030
Are you saying that nobody who really
knows me could ever love me?

262
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,575
- No, no, no. Not nobody. No.
- No.

263
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,744
What am I doing here?

264
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:56,581
I don't know where you're going,
but if you could run there.

265
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:13,055
Sextina, hi. Thanks for meeting me here.
I'm really excited to be working with you.

266
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:16,934
Listen, chitch, if you're going
to tweet for sextina aquafina,

267
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,604
you need to capture the essence
of my personal brand, okay?

268
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,608
All upper caps, no punctuation, lots
of cryptic bullshit about the illuminati

269
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,277
and make sure to mention
my preferred brands, okay?

270
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:32,450
Beats by dre, Abercrombie
and Fitch and brand fin Polish.

271
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:36,204
- Can you spell that last one?
- No.

272
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,498
I gotta go get my blowhole bleached.

273
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:44,295
Hey, thank you so much.
You people are the real stars. Huh?

274
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,511
Hi. I'm Sarah koenig.

275
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:55,181
This is one ringtone told over
the course of several rings.

276
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:59,060
And the story it's telling you
is to answer your phone.

277
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:01,771
- Heho?
- Hey, Diane.

278
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,481
Hey. Uh...

279
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:09,320
So. How's cordovia?

280
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,614
It's hard.

281
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:17,787
- Do you know where the batteries are?
- What?

282
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:22,208
- The batteries in the remote died.
- Did you check the junk drawer?

283
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,252
Yeah, I looked in the junk drawer.

284
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,420
I'm gonna take them
out of the smoke detector.

285
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,549
- No, don't do that.
- Well, I'm out of options.

286
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:35,179
Listen, I know this sounds crazy, but I
think maybe you should get back here

287
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:39,058
- so you can help me find the batteries.
- Yeah?

288
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:42,353
I know you're doing important work
and it's a long way to travel,

289
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,232
but I need you here
and I think you should come home.

290
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:51,112
- Is that really what you want?
- Of course it is.

291
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:57,159
Well, okay, I'm looking
at this website right now

292
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:01,706
and it says if I leave immediately,
I can still make it home tonight.

293
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:05,418
- That sounds great.
- I love you.

294
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:09,547
I love you too, Diane.
You know, it's the funniest thing.

295
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:12,466
There is a woman in this restaurant
who looks just like you.

296
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:16,387
Ha, ha.
I guess I just have one of those faces.

297
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:23,269
Okay, party people,
we have time for one more suggestion.

298
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,479
- Todd.
- Did someone say movie theater?

299
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,189
I heard movie theater.

300
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:31,110
I'm Abe Lincoln and I'm gonna wear
my giant hat to the movies.

301
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:35,114
Who's this sitting behind me?
John wilkes booth. Uh-oh.

302
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:38,784
- Todd, it's me, bojack.
- Bojack?

303
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,912
- Todd, I'm getting you out of here.
- I can't leave.

304
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:43,372
I need to take suggestions.

305
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,792
Okay, well, here's a suggestion,
your name is Todd.

306
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:53,758
You're 24, you live on my couch and
you've always seen the good in me somehow.

307
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,593
You've been brainwashed into thinking

308
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,429
that you belong here, but you don't.
You belong back home.

309
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,349
If you're any kind of improviser,
you'll take that suggestion

310
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,642
and you'll run with it.

311
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:03,809
Huh.

312
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,104
Let's get out of here.

313
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:10,608
I'm afraid that getting out of here
is not an option.

314
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:14,153
- You've seen too much.
- What the hell are you gonna do about it?

315
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,490
- Stop you. With these.
- Oh, no.

316
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,201
- Don't do anything crazy, guys.
- You can't be serious.

317
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,536
- Just get behind me, bojack.
- No sudden moves.

318
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,373
Be reasonable.
You wouldn't wanna puncture the hull.

319
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,709
Especially not when I have this
smoke bomb.

320
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,212
- I've lost them. Where did they go?
- Seriously?

321
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:35,174
Now feel the wrath of my flamethrower.

322
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,260
Too bad we're wearing sunscreen

323
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:42,181
with spf a million which protects
against flamethrowers.

324
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:43,599
Oh, no.

325
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:46,519
Now we finish this
with our strangle machine.

326
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:47,812
Beep, boop, boop. Machine?

327
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:52,358
- Strangle those guys.
- Ugh! Bojack, help.

328
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,153
There is literally nothing
happening to you.

329
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,325
You don't understand, if you die
in improv, you die in real life.

330
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:04,870
So stupid. Fine.
I guess I have a guard killing machine?

331
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,580
Beep, boop, beep.

332
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,583
No. I have a wife and children.

333
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,253
Well, they're improvised,
but they're real to me.

334
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:19,427
- Can this be the end?
- This whole ship is full of idiots.

335
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,303
Beep, boop.

336
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,352
Come on, come on, come on.

337
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,688
Come on, come on, Todd.
We're almost there.

338
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,523
Wait. Where are you going?

339
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,651
Sorry, improv is fun
and great and everything,

340
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:40,489
but you guys are really into improv.
I'm gonna go with my friend.

341
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,284
Your friend?
I didn't realize this man was your friend.

342
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:46,328
Well, then, by all means,
go with him, Todd.

343
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:50,249
But, see, I thought this was the man
who sabotaged your rock opera.

344
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:55,337
The one who constantly abuses you and
makes you shower with a hose in the yard.

345
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,797
I invited him to.

346
00:20:56,964 --> 00:21:00,593
The one who's never said a kind word
to you the entire time you've known him.

347
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,723
- Is this your friend, Todd?
- It's more complicated than that.

348
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:10,269
- Is it? We're your friends, Todd.
- More than that, we're a family.

349
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:14,064
- I, uh...
- Hash browns.

350
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,484
- What?
- I heard hash browns.

351
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,904
- Martha, did you see my hash browns?
- Oh, my god, do you ever turn it off?

352
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:24,617
It was hash browns, not pancakes.
The first morning you stayed with me.

353
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:28,287
You kept making them and I kept eating
them and then I threw up in the pool.

354
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:32,333
That made you throw up in the pool. Then I
got mad at you for throwing up in my pool.

355
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,628
- But, you said, "I'll clean it up."
- And did I clean it up?

356
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,297
No. You didn't.
I had to call the pool cleaner.

357
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:39,924
- Ha, ha.
- And you said,

358
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,550
"thank you for letting me stay here.

359
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:45,304
I don't have anywhere else to go."
And I remember when you said that,

360
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:49,350
"I don't have anywhere else to go,"
because I felt good about myself.

361
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:51,769
And I don't feel that way a lot.

362
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:55,481
Letting you stay with me
was the best thing I ever did on purpose.

363
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:58,317
I don't think I ever told you that.
But I should have.

364
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:01,028
Because you're my best friend, Todd.

365
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:05,991
I'm not gonna lie, if you just made all
that up, that was some really good improv.

366
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,369
Game recognize game.

367
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:14,583
- Why do you have a boat?
- Uh, I don't remember.

368
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:21,090
- Hello? Prince?
- Listen, bozo, I keep getting calls

369
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:24,051
from this New York playwright,
she really wants to talk to you.

370
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,096
- She says you know her, Jill pill?
- Jill pill?

371
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:30,057
Ring any bells?
Apparently she worked on your TV show.

372
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,060
- Horsin'around?
- No, actually. The other TV show.

373
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,438
Other TV show? Oh, shit. Jill.

374
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:39,608
I'm moving into the new office
and I got herb's ashes here.

375
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,902
I really don't know what
to do with this thing.

376
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,863
- Do you want it?
- Yeah.

377
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:47,658
Why did I take you with me?

378
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:52,121
Herb loved orphans.

379
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,957
Mostly as a delivery apparatus
for hackneyed punchlines

380
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:56,792
and mawkish sentimentality,
but still.

381
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:59,753
And we will do our part
to honor his legacy.

382
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,714
- Hey, who's jerb?
- What?

383
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:04,550
Jerb? Why does it say "jerb kazzaz?"

384
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:07,928
Your e-mail said "jerb."
I forwarded it to the plaque guy.

385
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,681
- Is it not...?
- No, obviously that was a typo.

386
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:14,435
Why would I want to dedicate the orphanage
to the memory of jerb kazzaz?

387
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:17,688
Kind of sounds like something you'd get
at a mediterranean restaurant,

388
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:18,897
but wouldn't finish.

389
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:22,526
And the waiter would say, "you want me
to box up this jerb kazzaz for you?"

390
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:25,154
- And you'd say, "no."
- You gotta fix this.

391
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,616
Really? We spent a lot of money
on this plaque, you know?

392
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,993
- And on the t-shirts.
- Jerb's kids?

393
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,537
No, there's no jerb. It's herb.

394
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:36,832
T-shirt's say jerb
so I'm going by the t-shirts.

395
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:42,588
You know, herb would probably think
that this is pretty funny

396
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:46,759
- that you couldn't even get this right.
- Yeah. He would.

397
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:50,888
- So in a way...
- Yeah.

398
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,723
You wanna get some
mediterranean food?

399
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,768
You read my mind.

400
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:01,774
Oh, god. Lungs on fire.

401
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:11,533
Ow. Crap, I hate this.
Running is terrible.

402
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,243
Everything is the worst.

403
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,793
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

404
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,214
- It gets easier.
- Huh?

405
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:27,758
Every day, it gets a little easier.

406
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,886
- Yeah?
- But you gotta do it every day.

407
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:34,974
That's the hard part.
But it does get easier.

408
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:39,979
Okay.
