1
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,305
- Huh?
- 0h, uh, it's a pet name.

2
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:15,557
I don't have actual honey.

3
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:17,267
Diane!

4
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:20,479
Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter. Mwah.

5
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:22,231
Bojack horseman!

6
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:24,066
- Put her there!
- That's all right.

7
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:25,692
I'm gonna get that handshake.

8
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:26,985
No, you're not.

9
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,392
Since when am I honey?

10
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:29,905
Since now.

11
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:31,990
I made up the nickname
while you were back east.

12
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,368
Yeah, really? You made up
calling someone honey?

13
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:35,994
Uh, I do believe so. Yes.

14
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:37,746
Hey, why don't we give
bojack a ride?

15
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:39,265
That's okay.
Todd's supposed to pick me up.

16
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,541
Where is he?

17
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,628
First day, huh?

18
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:46,713
Well, stick with me.
You're gonna be just fi...

19
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:52,636
Probably just forgot,
the lazy bum.

20
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:54,843
Hey, I'll take the ride
as long as it's not as bumpy

21
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,306
as that pilot's landing.

22
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,975
That was seriously very scary.

23
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,018
- Hey...
- I'm just glad you were there,

24
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,121
because I really would have
freaked out by myself.

25
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,147
Be stiller, my beating heart.

26
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,899
Stiller crazy
after all these years.

27
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,627
Did I miss something funny?

28
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:09,771
- I love funny somethings.
- No, we were just laughing

29
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:12,155
about this Ben stiller article
from the plane.

30
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,682
Ooh, he is the best.

31
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,617
- What did it say?
- You wouldn't get it.

32
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,161
Either you read hemisphere's
magazine, or you don't.

33
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,998
Hey, I might be crazy, because
this is such a dumb question,

34
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,375
and I'm embarrassed to even ask,

35
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:27,921
but do I have anything to worry
about with you and Diane?

36
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,756
What?

37
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,593
What?

38
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,219
Get out of here.

39
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:36,513
I got to say, bojack,

40
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,098
that is a relief.

41
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:41,435
Ho-ho! Whoo!

42
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,325
Hey, do you guys
want to grab dinner?

43
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,701
Or at least some road sodas,

44
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,495
so I don't have
to go through the ordeal

45
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,348
of sobering up and then having
to get drunk all over again?

46
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,499
Oh, I actually already made
special plans

47
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:46,833
for just the two of us.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,251
Oh, come on.

49
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,753
You're the one
who's always saying

50
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,630
you want to hang out
with bojack more,

51
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:53,358
and how it's weird that bojack
never returns your calls,

52
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:55,050
and how I should
hang up the phone

53
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:56,903
because maybe bojack's
trying to call you right now.

54
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,428
Uh, okay.

55
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,473
I guess we can make this work.

56
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,350
Oh.

57
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,769
Oh, man.
Remember that guy in 34-8?

58
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:08,563
Do I? Can't stop
remembering him.

59
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,524
Uh, hey.
Diane and I have memories too.

60
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,276
This place reminds me
of a Cliffside meal we had

61
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,862
one romantic vacay to cabo.

62
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,239
Boring. I wasn't there.

63
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,658
Can we keep this
general interests?

64
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,786
Well, here's to a meal
we're all here for.

65
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,162
Mmm.

66
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,706
Oh, oh. Ew.

67
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,032
There's something in my food.

68
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,309
Ah, crap.
Someone get the manager.

69
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,918
No, no, no. Wait.

70
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:32,754
It's supposed to be in there.
Welcome home, honey.

71
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:37,342
I got you a d pendant,
because I am d-pendant on you.

72
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:39,302
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Real... real cute.

73
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,972
- A d for dog.
- It's for Diane.

74
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:45,642
This is the sweetest choking
hazard anyone's ever given me.

75
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,644
Mwah.

76
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,789
Well, how about some champagne
for the happy couple.

77
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,648
Waiter, get me a bottle of dom

78
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,192
to keep with the trend
of sweet d gifts.

79
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,861
You're too kind,

80
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:59,030
but everyone knows you go off
menu for the good stuff.

81
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,700
Yes, get me your most expensive
bottle from the back.

82
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:05,370
Perhaps a 1922-ish heidsieck
diamant bleu?

83
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:08,665
A toast on me
to Diane and Mr. Peanutbutter.

84
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,667
I'd like a round of drinks
for everyone.

85
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,169
Off the menu, of course.

86
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:15,338
Bojack, folks. What a sport.

87
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,382
And while we're all
in giving moods,

88
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:21,011
I'd like to buy you all an Xbox,
courtesy of me.

89
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,473
Wow. You guys don't
have to do this.

90
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,767
Look, I could happily
go down this petty road

91
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,161
of raising and re-raising
one another.

92
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:29,561
Please do!

93
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,368
But I'd instead
like to highlight the fact

94
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,116
that Mr. Peanutbutter's
ripping off my toast

95
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:36,151
the same way he ripped off
my entire career.

96
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,987
Uh, we prefer gifts
over observations.

97
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:41,698
Okay. Well, here's something
I didn't rip off.

98
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,867
This brand-new helicopter
I just bought.

99
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,369
Whoo-whoo! Who wants a ride
in the chopper?

100
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,806
Okay, guys. This has been fun,

101
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,333
and also an offensive display
of extravagant wealth,

102
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,900
but maybe we should
call it a night.

103
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,085
What's the rush?

104
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,438
Because I just bought
the restaurant,

105
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:56,922
and we can stay
as long as we want.

106
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,399
Hey, you. I own you now.

107
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:01,218
Do a dance.

108
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,097
Oops.

109
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,641
Oh, no. Hey, sorry, bud.

110
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,810
- It's all yours.
- Please, you first.

111
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,229
Apparently we both
like to be clean.

112
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:15,440
I love being clean.
That's so coincidental.

113
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,150
- I'm Todd.
- Klaus.

114
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,069
Look, I know you're new here,

115
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:23,698
but we have a lot in common:
Being white, into cleansing.

116
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,284
I think you'd enjoy hanging out
with me and the gang.

117
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,663
When you say "the gang,"
do you mean a gang?

118
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,349
Check this out.
If you want to lift weights,

119
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,124
we got great yard connecfions.

120
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,418
If you like toilet wine,
we spent the past 20 years

121
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,003
perfecting pruno.

122
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,756
The Aryan nation is number one
for a reason.

123
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,216
Never thought I'd say this,

124
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,510
but you put a pretty good
spin on Nazis.

125
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,446
Hey, tell you what.
Drop by our party tomorrow.

126
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,556
Shoot the shit with the guys,
mostly about Jews,

127
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,349
and make up your own mind.

128
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,059
Until then, take my card.

129
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:54,521
Whoa. Uh, where were you
keeping that card?

130
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,524
45, 46,

131
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:02,320
guys, can we give this thing
a rest?

132
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,030
Rest? Why rest? I'm not tired.

133
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,157
I'm twice as not tired.

134
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:16,001
Or d, sex and candy?

135
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,212
Bojack!

136
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,006
Todd, where the hell
have you been?

137
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,674
I had to carpool home
from the airport

138
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,551
like a goddamn environmentalist.

139
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,720
I'm sorry,
but I'm in jail, dude.

140
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,207
Well, you called the right
person, because I need your help

141
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:30,682
and you're my phone-a-friend.

142
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,685
Marie curie won nobel prizes
in which two sciences?

143
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:35,270
A, chemistry and physics.

144
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:38,315
- B, biology and physics...
- Oh, b! The answer's b!

145
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,733
- It's a!
- Damn it, Todd!

146
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,276
This was life or death.

147
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,403
Same with me.
The bail's set at 50 bucks.

148
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,530
I'll be here wa...

149
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,622
Yes! I am the champion
of the games!

150
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,749
Did you see that, Diane?

151
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,208
Diane?

152
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,460
You win, old friend.

153
00:06:58,627 --> 00:06:59,961
Now if you'll excuse me,

154
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,547
I'm going to take
my girlfriend to bed.

155
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:05,634
We're still out?

156
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,595
Night, bojack.

157
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,014
Good night, Diane.

158
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:14,142
Give me a bottle of something
to help me forget my problems.

159
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:15,977
Ooh, maybe not that strong.

160
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,687
What is this, breakfast?

161
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,397
Yeah, that's about right.

162
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,615
Well, that worked effectively.

163
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,784
It's a Holly-who-done-it

164
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,431
as police are scrambling
to figure out

165
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,205
who stole the d from
the famed Hollywood sign.

166
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,582
- Holly-what?
- All of tinseltown 's

167
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,627
at defcon 5 until their
diabolically displaced d

168
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,088
is demonstrably displayed
once more.

169
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,756
Can we cool it
with the alliteration?

170
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,509
Who wrote this copy?
Randy, I'm looking at you.

171
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:49,177
Weird.

172
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:50,428
Weirder.

173
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,890
Why the hell would I steal
a giant d?

174
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,850
Ding-dong! It's Diane.

175
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,478
D... d... damn!

176
00:07:58,645 --> 00:07:59,980
Meanwhile, local authorities

177
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,826
are already investigating
several suspects.

178
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,234
David duchovny,
dick Van dyke, dmx,

179
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,153
and of course Dane cook,
who we all know is a thief.

180
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,448
Hey, d-voted memoirist.

181
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,118
I can't work on the book today.
Too ill. Cough.

182
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,078
Are you ill, or hung-over?

183
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,580
Because instead of coughing
you just said the word cough.

184
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,350
Plus you left me along,
drunken voicemail last night.

185
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:20,500
Ooh, was it bad?

186
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,936
It was mostly a lot of wheezing,

187
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,336
as if you were
climbing something,

188
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,106
followed by the sounds
of dismantling metal,

189
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,607
and then grunting like you were
dragging something heavy

190
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:27,966
at least a few miles.

191
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:29,968
I didn't say anything
incriminating, did I?

192
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,886
As incriminating
as that question? No.

193
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,430
Good. Well, just as
a general rule,

194
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,782
you probably shouldn't
be listening

195
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,349
to any voicemails
I leave after...

196
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,076
- What time do I start drinking?
- Noon?

197
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,145
- Yup. See you later.
- But we had an appointment.

198
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,272
What's that? An actor flaking
on an obligation?

199
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,479
- Welcome to Hollywood.
- I think you mean hollywoo.

200
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,484
Did you see? Someone stole the d
off the sign.

201
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:47,962
Cough, cough, cough,
cough, cough.

202
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,238
Cough, cough, cough,
cough, door slam.

203
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,198
What is it, bojack?

204
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,576
You know, I'm tied up
with all my deans today.

205
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,536
Kane, Norris, winters,
and koontz,

206
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,371
all being questioned by police.

207
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,998
It was me. I stole the d.

208
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,666
- What?
- Now be a good agent

209
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:02,993
and make this not my problem.

210
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,711
How did you even...?

211
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,106
You know, your scandal-to-work
ratio is, like, five to one.

212
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,108
Look, I need to get rid
of this before Diane sees it.

213
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,426
Why do you
care if dia... oh, fish.

214
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,678
Are you in love
with your biographer?

215
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,805
What?

216
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,308
What?

217
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,351
Get out of here.

218
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:23,521
You stole the d for Diane.
Unbelievable.

219
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,291
Yeah, I don't know.
The d might be for David,

220
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,816
because apparently
when I was drunk,

221
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,319
I printed out a bunch
of pictures of David boreanaz.

222
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,946
Yeah. You did that.

223
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,883
Look, I'll keep your little
crush busy long enough

224
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,347
for you to get rid
of the contraband,

225
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,677
but the next three weddings
I'm invited to,

226
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,203
you're my date, dummy.

227
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,830
Since when to women your age
get invited to weddings?

228
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,357
I have a lot
of nieces and nephews!

229
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,977
Well, you pulled it off,

230
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,419
you deviant.

231
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,130
Get it? D-viant?

232
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,673
- I got it.
- Tell me,

233
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,680
how are you gonna complete
your giant bracelet?

234
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,403
With the chain-link fence
from dodger's stadium?

235
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,097
No. How'd you figure out
it was me?

236
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,808
Oh, how did I figure it out?
Well, I just followed the clues,

237
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,769
used deduction, puzzle-solving,
a little bit of forensics,

238
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,521
and also, what did I do?

239
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,815
Oh, I listened to the voicemail
you left me

240
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,359
saying you were stealing the d
because of Diane

241
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:12,821
so I could, and I quote,
"suck your d."

242
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,781
Stop leaving voicemails!

243
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,033
Admit it!
You like my girlfriend.

244
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,078
Oh, come on. I mean,
am I attracted to her? Sure.

245
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,288
Do my days feel better
when I'm around her? Yeah.

246
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,125
Does she get me in ways
no woman ever has? Indubitably.

247
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,752
Do I fantasize about her?
Yes, but only in two positions.

248
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,814
Look, am I the kind of guy
who would try to steal

249
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:30,964
someone else's girlfriend?

250
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,549
Sure, of course,
but do I like her?

251
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,968
The answer's no.
You have nothing to worry about.

252
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,553
I'll cut you a deal.

253
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,388
I help you get rid of that d,

254
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:41,391
and you never talk
to Diane again.

255
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:44,227
Well, I have to talk to her,
because she's writing my book.

256
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:47,313
Okay, but just don't
pursue her romantically?

257
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,107
- Deal.
- Ha!

258
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:52,235
- I knew I'd get that handshake.
- I regret this already.

259
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:59,159
Spread them wide, ladies.
This is a random cavity search.

260
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,786
Whoa! Buy a guy a drink first.

261
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,746
Did we just say that...

262
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,707
- Oh!
- At the same time?

263
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,459
Look, I saw you talking
to Klaus in the shower.

264
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,588
Now, the Aryan's are good guys.
Don't get me wrong.

265
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,023
But I don't know
if you're gonna get

266
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,757
the right attention over there.

267
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,093
Uh, I'd hate to get lost
in a shop that big.

268
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,012
Now we can't
offer you the works,

269
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,222
but in the Latin kings,
you'll be a star.

270
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,809
We're number two,
and that means we try harder.

271
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:27,312
Am I really being courted
by two gangs?

272
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:30,231
Oh, I feel like
the belle of the ball.

273
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,402
So, this is the shapeless
biographer

274
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:36,154
I've heard so much about.

275
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,656
We've met several times.

276
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,491
Did you just call me here
to insult me?

277
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,118
-What is your secret, lady?

278
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,579
I mean, how do you get
two grown men fighting over you

279
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,581
like a foul ball
at a football game?

280
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:48,475
First of all, football doesn't
have foul balls.

281
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,834
Ugh, sports.

282
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,503
Second of all,
nobody's fighting over me.

283
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,838
Open your eyes.

284
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,715
Bojack's clearly
in love with you.

285
00:11:55,882 --> 00:12:01,387
Wha...?

286
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,931
Get out of here!

287
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,700
Get out of here?
Why would I get out of here?

288
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,768
You get out of here.
This is my office.

289
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,605
I get the army men are police,

290
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,190
but what's the mustard packet
again?

291
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,025
Oh, that's just
a mustard packet.

292
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:15,610
- It's left over from lunch.
- Oh.

293
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,137
Well, can we move it
off the table?

294
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:18,475
No. I still might want it later.

295
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,614
Good call.

296
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,616
So how do we get the d from here

297
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,368
all the way up to here?

298
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,078
What with all these cops
and mustards,

299
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,663
- it's gonna be a pickle.
- Oh, no.

300
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,515
The pickle's a SWAT Van,
but I see your point.

301
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:32,627
Might be easier to just ditch
the evidence. But how?

302
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,254
- I... I don't know.

303
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,500
You think these coffees
would get the juices flowing.

304
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:37,900
Well, they do have Bailey's
in them.

305
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,467
Is that why I feel drunk?

306
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,552
Because I've had, like,
seven or eight coffees.

307
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,239
I mean, I admit,
it's been bad for ideas,

308
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,098
but it's been great
for camaraderie.

309
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,683
Couldn't agree more.

310
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,351
Ooh, hey. What time is it?

311
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:49,998
I probably need
to move my helicopter.

312
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,396
It's in a two-hour zone.

313
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,690
You beautiful bastard,
that's it!

314
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,693
We can pick up the d with your
chopper, fly it out of here,

315
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,278
and then dump it
out into the ocean.

316
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,696
Stupendous!

317
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,489
Take that, the ocean.

318
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,535
- What now, Todd?
- Listen.

319
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,788
So, kind of landed myself in a
two-dates-to-the-prom situation.

320
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:12,125
The dates being prison gangs
and the prom being a jump-in,

321
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,335
so do you remember how you got
out of the same jam

322
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:15,586
on horsin'around?

323
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,839
Ah, a classic conundrum.

324
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:20,675
Well, I recall one time
on Mr. Peanutbutter's house...

325
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:22,122
I think he's talking to me, pal.

326
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,469
You know, the guy whose show

327
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,763
invented the
two-dates-to-the-prom story.

328
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,891
You may have invented it, but
I think our show perfected it.

329
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,518
The only thing
you ever perfected

330
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,496
- was stealing my thunder.
- Stealing your thunder, eh?

331
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,320
Now you're even stealing
the words I'm saying.

332
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:35,815
You know, it's tough.

333
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,651
I agree with the Latin kings
on social issues,

334
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,361
but fiscally
I'm more of an Aryan.

335
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,196
Well, juggling both
never ends well.

336
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,073
Mr. Peanutbutter,
anything to contribute?

337
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,950
He's just staring blankly now.

338
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:49,704
Stealing your thunder.

339
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:52,415
You could also just
bail me out of here, as I said.

340
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:53,934
- It's only 50 bucks...
- Got to go, pal.

341
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,168
Hope it's a magical night.

342
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,562
All right,
you ready for the plan?

343
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,212
Oh, yeah.

344
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,548
But we are gonna need
a big distraction

345
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,967
to keep the eyes off the skies.

346
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:04,635
You leave that to me.

347
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,596
Whoa, wait.
You had a lot to drink.

348
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,931
You better have a cup of coffee.

349
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,978
Who loves you, people?

350
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:16,064
Look this way, news media.

351
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,525
A celebrity is throwing away
his hard-earned cash.

352
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,027
Everyone pay attention to me.

353
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,613
Oh, it's only
one-dollar bills, folks.

354
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,989
Don't bother.

355
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,033
No, it's still free,
spendable money.

356
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,826
This is a huge story.

357
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,370
Dollars are like the new penny.

358
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,872
Yeah. Cash is for poor people.

359
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,374
What is wrong with you bozos?

360
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,959
Just riot over
the damn money already.

361
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,628
Well, nothing to see here,
I guess.

362
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:39,837
J“ ooh, ooh j“

363
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,089
whoa!

364
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,132
J“ Jesus Christ, my ankle j"

365
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,675
oh, my god.

366
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,552
American singer-songwriter
Beyoncé is hurt.

367
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,513
Somebody help her!

368
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,681
Ring the alarm.
Irreplaceable pop icon

369
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,142
and independent woman
Beyoncé has been injured.

370
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,519
What more can you give us?

371
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,104
Details are sketchy
at this point,

372
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,272
but we do know
Beyoncé is a survivor,

373
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,067
and presumably
she will keep on surviving.

374
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,735
- But what happened?
- Well, Tom,

375
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,671
I'm being told she fell
on all the single dollars.

376
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,548
- All the single dollars?
- All the single dollars.

377
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,949
All the single dollars?

378
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,701
- All the single dollars.
- Bills, bills, bills.

379
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,037
We promise to provide live,
unflinching coverage

380
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,914
of this harrowing ordeal

381
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,458
of a star gone
from dangerously in love

382
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,377
to dangerously in peril.

383
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:22,130
Don't stop watching.

384
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:25,091
Mr. Peanutbutter, take her home.

385
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:33,891
Doctors have confirmed

386
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:37,186
that Beyoncé will never
perform again.

387
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:40,857
This just in. A break in
the story of the hollywoo heist.

388
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,443
We now go live to the house
of Mr. Peanutbutter,

389
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,778
star of
Mr. Peanutbutter's house.

390
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,156
Ah, jeez.
What did that idiot do?

391
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,907
Ladies and gentlemen
of the press,

392
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:54,245
I, and I alone, stole the d
from the hollywoo sign.

393
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,915
Just tell us, why'd you do it?

394
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,292
Oh, I'll tell you why.

395
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,128
I did it all
for my girlfriend, Diane.

396
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,088
Aww.

397
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,007
Son of a bitch.

398
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:09,177
That literal son of a bitch.

399
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:12,138
If you're joining us,
Mr. Peanutbutter has confessed

400
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:15,057
to stealing the d
for his girlfriend Diane

401
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,810
in what many are calling
the most romantic gesture

402
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,937
in the history of romance
and gestures.

403
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,814
We now await
the I.A.P.D.'S move.

404
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,818
The day they make love a crime
is the day I turn in my badge.

405
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,865
And here's our lady
of the hour now, Diane.

406
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:33,117
Diane! What do you think?

407
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:37,580
Wow, Mr. Peanutbutter,
uh, it's kind of a lot.

408
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,540
I don't really like
to be on camera.

409
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,292
And?

410
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:44,670
Do you love anything or anyone?

411
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,923
I got to go.
We 'ii talk about it later.

412
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:53,846
J'oohj'

413
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,307
on, my Todd.

414
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:59,685
You look... you look beautiful,
homes.

415
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,812
What? This old thing?

416
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,064
The guards made me wear it.

417
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,899
Yeah, well, it suits you.

418
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,484
You're an Autumn, bro.

419
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,111
Ahh.

420
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,239
It's good, right?

421
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,534
Come meet my boy, sanfiago.

422
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,300
Uh, you know,
I'll... I'll be right back.

423
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:17,745
I... I left my cot unmade.

424
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,705
Ooh, watch it.

425
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,541
Oh, sorry I'm late.

426
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,544
Hope you didn't think I was
pulling an Anne frank on you.

427
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,963
Good one.

428
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,549
Can you believe it?

429
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,092
I was double-crossed
by the one man

430
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:34,011
I assumed was too stupid
to even single-cross.

431
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,097
What? I have no idea
what you're talking about.

432
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:38,099
I do have a life outside of you,
you know.

433
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,893
Mr. Peanutbutter took my d
and gave it to Diane.

434
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,479
Once again, he completely
ripped me off.

435
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,606
Oh, right. That whole thing.

436
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,024
Just a minute, Cate.

437
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,943
Look, you may have come up
with a log line,

438
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,570
but he's the one
who sold the pitch.

439
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,589
This is more on brand for him
than it is for you.

440
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,258
- What do you mean?
- Desecrated a major landmark

441
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:56,867
in a drunken stupor,
that's a bojack horseman thing.

442
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,411
But stealing it
for your girlfriend

443
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,162
as a grand display of affection?

444
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,998
That's Mr. Peanutbutter.

445
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:05,418
You're right.
It's Mr. Peanutbutter all over.

446
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,128
It's the kind of bold,
romantic gesture

447
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:08,796
they base movies on.

448
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,298
Actually, that's not a bad idea.

449
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:13,050
Laura? Check if anyone's
bought the rights yet.

450
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,528
Can we keep this about me,
please?

451
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,220
Even if he stole
your stealing of the d,

452
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:19,056
what he made his was telling
Diane how he felt

453
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,266
from his heart.

454
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:21,642
You could never say it to me,

455
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,227
and you still
can't say it to her.

456
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,271
That's not true.
I can express feelings.

457
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:29,400
Nothing on the outside.
Nothing on the inside.

458
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,295
Look, I got to bounce.
Quick question, though.

459
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:34,155
Would you see Cate blanchett
in a movie about Eva braun?

460
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:35,823
Why are you wasting my time
with this?

461
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,951
Of course I would. Who wouldn't?

462
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,788
And that's why Eva braun

463
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,249
was like the fifth beatle
of the third reich.

464
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:50,212
Wow. I never knew Neo-Nazis
were so interested in Nazis.

465
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,174
You got some great moves, Todd.

466
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:56,719
You dance like a white man,
and I love it.

467
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,721
Hey, no disrespect,

468
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,974
but I got a few chess pieces
I forgot need whittling.

469
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,309
Oh, excuse me.

470
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,645
Oh, thank god you're back.

471
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,147
I was getting nervous that
you left me for another gang.

472
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,319
If that happened,
I'd have to kill you.

473
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,660
Thank you for rescheduling

474
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,953
given your recent, uh,
everything.

475
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,706
Yeah. That was really something.

476
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,709
I guess he makes
your heart stand stiller?

477
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,545
Yeah, but for some reason
the jury's stiller out

478
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,172
on how I feel about it.

479
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,091
Well, that's because
it wasn't for you.

480
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,760
That wasn't a Diane thing.
It was a Mr. Peanutbutter thing.

481
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,845
Well, what would be
a Diane thing?

482
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,390
A Diane thing would be
something that shows

483
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,308
he really knows you,

484
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:47,561
like giving you an iPod loaded
with all your favorite podcasts,

485
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,188
or a practical houseplant,

486
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,023
or surprising you
with a bound album

487
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,733
of photos and emails he saved.

488
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,569
That's... that's what the Diane
I know would want.

489
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:56,821
What are you saying to me?

490
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,322
Just that you should be

491
00:19:58,489 --> 00:19:59,782
with someone who knows you.

492
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,992
Yeah? Like who?

493
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,869
|...

494
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,413
Whoa, were we... were we taping?

495
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:06,831
Um, okay.

496
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,266
Uh, you want to hear
my Andy dick story?

497
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,251
It's a doozie.

498
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,922
All we ask for is 10%
of anything pilfered.

499
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:17,133
Drugs, cigarettes.

500
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,801
I mean, that's the standard
gang rate.

501
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:24,306
Hey, I got to go, uh,
do a prison thing.

502
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,435
That sounds legitimate.
We are in prison, after all.

503
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,272
Whew. Hey.

504
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,566
White people, right?

505
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,569
Todd? Why in the name
of pat Buchanan

506
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,738
are you dressed
like a Latin king?

507
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,281
- Uh, what...
- What the hell, bro?

508
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:42,283
- Are you playing both sides?
- Look, guys,

509
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,745
I didn't want to choose between
you because I like you both.

510
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,913
Look, in fact, if you just
took the time

511
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,833
to get to know each other
the way you did me,

512
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,335
I think you'd agree
we don't need gangs anymore

513
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:58,299
because, deep down,
we're all just people.

514
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,134
What do you say?

515
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,762
This just in.
A standoff at the super Max

516
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,681
has turned into
a full-on race war.

517
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:09,018
But first, america has fallen
in love with hollywoo it-couple,

518
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:11,270
Mr. Peanutbutter and Diane...

519
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:18,861
Diane? Is that you?

520
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,073
Hey. It's, um, me.

521
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,869
Look, uh, things got
a bit weird earlier,

522
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,455
so I... I want to make sure
that we're still on for tomorrow

523
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,957
to talk about the time
I sneezed on Marisa tomei.

524
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,793
I'm really sorry about before.

525
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,544
I know the d was overkill,

526
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,172
so I got you something
more personal.

527
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,590
Aww.

528
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:42,384
I also wanted to just, um,
let you know

529
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,762
how much I appreciate you
working on this book with me.

530
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,975
I know I sometimes
get carried away,

531
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,769
but it's because
I love you so much.

532
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,771
You're a catch, Diane,

533
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:56,565
and I think you know
how much I love catch.

534
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,109
And I'm sorry if I've been
difficult in any way

535
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,861
during this process.

536
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,714
You know, it's... it's really hard
to have somebody,

537
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,241
I don't know, know you, I guess.

538
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,785
And you do, uh, know me, Diane.

539
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:10,454
We're very different,
but I think we bring out

540
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:12,081
the best in each other.

541
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:13,791
It's like you're chocolate
and I'm...

542
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,668
- Peanutbutter?
- What? Now see?

543
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,962
That was so much better
than what I was gonna say.

544
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:21,090
I was gonna say carrots.

545
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:22,716
And I know I'm not
the perfect guy.

546
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,178
I actually kind of hate myself
a lot of the time.

547
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:30,015
But when... when I'm with you,
I, uh, don't hate myself.

548
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,476
I like being around you,

549
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,203
and I don't know
if I ever told you that

550
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:36,981
in so many words,
so I'm telling you.

551
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:40,109
Diane, I've got an important
question to ask.

552
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:42,736
No cameras, no big spectacle.

553
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,698
Just me and you.

554
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,157
Call me back.

555
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,118
This was bojack, by the way.

556
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:50,703
Horseman, obviously.

557
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,621
Will you do me the honor...

558
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,000
Of becoming Mrs. Peanutbutter?

559
00:22:56,166 --> 00:23:00,087
Wow. This is happening so fast.

560
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:02,590
Yes. I'll marry you.

561
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,091
But I'm keeping my last name.

562
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:06,927
You hear that? She said yes!

563
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,488
Let's kick it!

564
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,347
Erica, did you hear
she said yes?

565
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:13,183
Come on in here! All right!

566
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:18,105
She's not gonna call.
Get out the consolation scotch.

567
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:21,377
It's her!
Make that celebration scotch.

568
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,193
- What's the diff?
- It's the same scotch!

569
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,862
Diane! Hey, you!

570
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:26,614
Hey.

571
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,407
So this is weird.

572
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:31,201
I'm engaged.

573
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,287
Oh, wow.

574
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:35,289
To Mr. Peanutbutter?

575
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:37,625
I saw you left me a voicemail...

576
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,728
Delete it. It's just a drunken
recipe for bundt cake.

577
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:40,836
Not important.

578
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,296
Okay. I got to go.

579
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:43,964
They're about to move
the d back.

580
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,717
- See you tomorrow?
- Absolutely.

581
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:52,514
Well, nobody knows me like you.

582
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,728
Time to bring this baby home.

583
00:23:57,895 --> 00:23:59,897
To think I went from flying
missions over kandahar

584
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:02,024
to this cushy crap.

585
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:04,944
I spoke too soon!

586
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,571
Black hawk down!
Black hawk down!

587
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:10,324
See, you guys
aren't so different.

588
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,374
We're free! We're free!

589
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,667
- Yeah!
- Freedom!

590
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,752
- I am free!
- Freedom!

591
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,837
Oh, wow.

592
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,506
What a twist, huh?

593
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:29,218
And they say there's
no new stories in hollywoo.

594
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:34,431
J“ hollywoo, hollywoo j“

595
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:39,228
J“ back in the '903 j”

596
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:43,941
j“ I was in a very famous TV show j“

597
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,779
- j“ I'm bojack the horse j“
- I bojack j“

598
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:52,992
j“ bojack the horse,
don't act like you don't know j“

599
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:59,832
j“ and I'm trying to hold on to my past j“

600
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:04,461
j“ it's been so long
I don't think I'm gonna last j“

601
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:08,507
j“ I guess I'll just try
and make you understand j“

602
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:12,761
j“ that I'm more horse than a man j'

603
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:17,141
j“ or I'm more man than a horse j“

604
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:21,687
j“ bojack j“

605
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:25,566
boxer versus raptor.
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na!
