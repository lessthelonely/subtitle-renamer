1
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,691
BoJack! Beautiful day, huh?

2
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:26,985
Perfect day to go outside,
not read the trades

3
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:30,030
or talk to anyone in the industry
or watch entertainment television

4
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:33,325
or have a gut feeling about the ratings
for your television show last night.

5
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:36,370
- Princess Carolyn, I'm dying.
- You read the trades.

6
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:39,122
My heart is in my stomach,
my stomach is in my butt,

7
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,041
and my butt ran away with the spoon.

8
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:44,253
That makes sense
because your butt is quite a dish.

9
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:46,088
Can you come over? I need you.

10
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,343
What the...?

11
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:56,723
I ordered a few feel-better pizzas
to feel better. It did not work.

12
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:59,768
Then I sprinkled happy pills on them,
and washed it all down

13
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:03,230
with a "Please, God, make my pain go away"
vermouth and ice cream float.

14
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,524
- Somehow I feel worse.
- That's a real mystery.

15
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:08,986
My show was terrible.
Why did I insist on a mockumentary format?

16
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,114
It's already an overused trope now,
in 2007.

17
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,159
Hey! Mockumentary is not a trope,
it's a device for storytelling.

18
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:19,871
And your show is daring and cutting edge.
People just aren't ready.

19
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:22,332
Yeah. Yeah, people! It's not me.

20
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,376
It's the people that are the problem!

21
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:27,671
Everyone's dumb and I am great.
Why do I always forget that?

22
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:28,839
That's the spirit.

23
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,883
I'm starting to think this show is
the best thing that happened to me.

24
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:32,801
- Really?
- Yeah.

25
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,721
It made me realize you're the best thing
that happened to me,

26
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,348
with your sexy cat eyes
and your cute little hair curl.

27
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,892
You look like a soft serve
strawberry ice cream.

28
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:44,396
BoJack, we can't. I'm your agent.

29
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,025
You are so much more than that.
You're my lighthouse, my Garmin.

30
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,652
You're the little plastic table
they put in pizza boxes

31
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:52,863
to keep the pizza from getting smushed.

32
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,364
You're Princess Carolyn.

33
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:02,748
Don't you break my heart,
BoJack Horseman.

34
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,124
- What?
- What? Nothing.

35
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:07,628
- Did you just say something to me?
- No, I was just being wistful, I guess.

36
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,547
Well, can you be wistful a little quieter?

37
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:13,925
- Not everyone is interested in your wist.
- Okay, BoJack.

38
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,347
- You smell nice.
- Thanks, BoJack.

39
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:27,773
<i>♪♪</i>

40
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:26,832
Okay, gotta go. I'm about to meet
my most important client.

41
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,751
- I know you're not really on the phone.
- Bye, Mr. President.

42
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:33,088
Give my love to your basketball friends.
You too.

43
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,590
Should we get dinner,
or are you just thinking drinks?

44
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,968
- I'm not planning on staying long.
- Okay.

45
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,763
I'm glad you wanted to meet,
because I am so pumped to tell you

46
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:44,474
all about the exciting projects
I'm lining up for you.

47
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:45,517
That won't be necessary.

48
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,562
Once you get your Oscar nom,
we'll have our pick. That's the key.

49
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,064
You think Halle Berry
would've been offered <i>Catwoman</i>

50
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,357
if she wasn't an Oscar winner?

51
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,609
We just gotta find you your <i>Catwoman.</i>

52
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,278
I'm not sure if a <i>Catwoman</i>

53
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,030
is really the best thing
for my career right now.

54
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:01,783
Right, well, like I said,
we are getting lots of offers.

55
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:02,951
Listen, Princess Carolyn--

56
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:06,163
<i>Signore </i>Horseman!
<i>Principessa </i>Carolina!

57
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,206
Sandro, how you doing,
you handsome devil?

58
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,710
To be honest I am, how you say,
sweating bull's nets.

59
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,754
- You mean sweating bullets?
- I don't think so.

60
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:16,506
Sweating bullets.
How does that make the sense?

61
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,258
How does sweating bull's nets
make sense?

62
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:22,137
I don't want to be caught in bull's nets.
He may try to kiss me.

63
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:27,642
I prefer kissing cows. No judgment,
just a preference. I love kissing cows!

64
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,519
Don't tell my wife. I'm kidding!

65
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,396
She knows. She's a cow!

66
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,066
And I only kiss her.

67
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,401
Okay, very good.

68
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:38,445
Haven't you lived in America for 30 years?

69
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,698
Ignore him. Why are you
sweating bullets and/or nets?

70
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:46,953
Ah. Because there is a restaurant critic
here tonight.

71
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:50,791
Very interesting.

72
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,502
Critics are the worst.
That's my review of critics.

73
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,587
Two thumbs down! Four percent fresh!

74
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,215
One star! You all eat a flat butt!

75
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,259
Did you not know there was a critic here?
You own this place.

76
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:03,595
I never see you do anything
to help run it.

77
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,347
This place runs itself. Right, Sandro?

78
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,267
Well, my wife and children and therapy man
may not agree so much,

79
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,061
but if you say so, <i>Signore </i>Horseman.

80
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,605
Even his wife and kids
and therapy man agree.

81
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:18,151
Well, as the Black Guy Pete say,
"Tonight's gonna be a good night."

82
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:19,820
Please. Enjoy.

83
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,906
I know you're not happy about
what happened with the Kelsey project.

84
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,284
I pushed a little too hard to get you
the money you deserve.

85
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:30,163
What can I say? Sometimes I'm too good
of an agent, so deals fall apart.

86
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,541
That's a thing that happens
when agents are really good.

87
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:33,917
- That's not--
- Moving forward!

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,503
I know you're not happy
with how I handled <i>Ethan Around.</i>

89
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,088
- Or didn't handle it.
- Bygones!

90
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,007
It was because I was busy
getting you the <i>Pegasus </i>movie,

91
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,426
which I know you did not get,
but trust me,

92
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,138
you'll see not getting these movies was
the best thing that ever happened to you.

93
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:50,225
Onwards and upwards!
Tally ho! To the stars!

94
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,477
Okay, you're forcing me to use the cards.

95
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:59,359
"Princess Carolyn, clear throat,
I have been very disappointed--"

96
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,027
Ring! Hello, Your Highness.

97
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,780
It's a king, I have to take this.
In the bathroom.

98
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:07,492
Oh, fish, oh, fish!

99
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:09,536
Who's out there?
Are you talking to me?

100
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,204
No.

101
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,123
All right, Pink Lady, think.

102
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,542
- Are you talking to me?
- Are you a pink lady?

103
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,503
I was a Pink Lady in my high
school's production of <i>Grease.</i>

104
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:21,298
- Were you Rizzo?
- No, Jan.

105
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,008
Then don't waste my time.

106
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,849
Now, let us bow our heads and bray.

107
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,070
Yes, right away!

108
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:50,368
So back to what you were--

109
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,787
- Oh, my goodness, what is this?
- Yeah, what is this?

Okay, cool.

119
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:19,522
Can you believe it, BoJack?
It's been almost a quarter of a century.

120
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,816
Talking on the phone
pretty much every day,

121
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,985
sharing our deepest dreams and secrets,

122
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:26,988
being there for each other
through all of it, bosom friends,

123
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,531
<i>Anne of Green Gables</i> style.

124
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:31,409
Let's toast to another 23 years.
What do you say?

125
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,912
- You're fired.
- Uh-- Oh.

126
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,790
I can't believe this. You're firing me?

127
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:37,958
- Me?
- What? No.

128
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,961
You have no idea,
everything I do around here!

129
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,338
- Half the kitchen staff is my family.
- No.

130
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,215
- Honestly, just--
- I detest you!

131
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,550
I hope you rot in the hell!

132
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:51,012
- We're headed down a road that--
- You washed-up has-been no-good joke!

133
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:53,264
You are the opposite of an onion,

134
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:57,018
because if I cut you, I am no gonna cry.

135
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,436
Well, now you are fired.

136
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,649
Good luck finding another charming
first-generation Italian immigrant

137
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:07,612
with this kind of darling accent,
who makes equally delightful malapropisms!

138
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:10,490
You, sir, have just cut off your nose

139
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,284
and thrown Sprite in your face!

140
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:18,039
I am a classic stereotype
that is tough to come by nowadays,

141
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:21,501
because Italians don't emigrate
so much to America no more.

142
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,795
Botticelli, Barbarelli, Beetle Bailey!

143
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,756
Modigliani, Masaccio, Marmaduke!

144
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,675
<i>Avanti,</i> all of you! <i>Andiamo!</i>

145
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,512
So that was weird, huh?

146
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,932
Please stop looking at me.

147
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,184
Too bad about Sandro, huh?

148
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:41,021
You're the one who's fired, obviously.

149
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:43,773
Right.

150
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:47,610
Ryan Murphy is doing a re-imagining
of <i>The Life and Times of Harriet Tubman.</i>

151
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:50,363
But in this version, she's a tub-man,

152
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:53,074
with the comparative strength
and agility of a tub!

153
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,701
- PC.
- He's looking for someone

154
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,120
to play the Underground
Railroad conductor.

155
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,122
Great, but you don't represent me anymore.

156
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,416
Okay, I get it. I'm fired. Sheesk.

157
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,002
You're gonna spend a couple days
being mad at me,

158
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:07,922
then I'll get you another gig, and you'll
be my client again, just like every time.

159
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,508
Can we get past the part
where you're mad at me

160
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:13,261
and get to the part where
you're stealing General Lee's plutonium

161
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:16,056
to fuel your subterranean
steam-punk slave-tram?

162
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,808
"It's best, for both of us,

163
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:22,103
if we end this relationship
once and for all."

164
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,939
I'm sorry I screwed up,
you don't have to read off the--

165
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:28,401
"You take me for granted, made decisions
that were against my wishes,

166
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:32,072
and worst of all
she's got my globes a-warming!"

167
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,491
- How did that get in there?
- What is that?

168
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,826
A punch line to a joke
from the roast of January Jones.

169
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,621
- A global warming joke?
- It's an important issue. Here we go.

170
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,498
"Our relationship no longer has any--"

171
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,917
"January has only gotten hotter and hot--"
Nope.

172
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,212
- Were you at the roast of January Jones?
- No, but I wrote some jokes

173
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,172
in case someone got sick
and they needed a backup.

174
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,217
Do you even know January Jones?
Why would they call you?

175
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,763
I guess I thought that my agent could
get me in the mix if Jason Sudeikis--

176
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,723
How did these get out of order?

177
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,892
So in the joke,
are the globes your balls?

178
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,144
And they get warm
when you see January Jones?

179
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,479
Is that how balls work?

180
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,397
I don't know. It's a work in progress.

181
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:07,857
Professional integrity!

182
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,610
"Our relationship no longer
has any professional integrity.

183
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,695
So it's gotta end. Stand to leave."

184
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,197
Shouldn't have read that part.

185
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,117
"When you reflect on this,
you'll see it's best for both of us.

186
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,244
Exit restaurant." Goddamn it.

187
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,080
Wow, that was--
I don't know what that was.

188
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,665
Hey! Where are you going?

189
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:29,295
- Who gave you this idea? Spanakopita?
- This has nothing to do with Ana.

190
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:30,880
Here you go, sir.

191
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,299
- I'll get it!
- You two are b'thumping.

192
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:34,884
Now you do whatever she says?

193
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,219
- Is that what's happening?
- No.

194
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,180
No, you're not b'thumping or no,
you're not doing whatever she says?

195
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,933
- I'm not doing whatever she says.
- So you <i>are </i>b'thumping.

196
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:46,312
I understand from context what you mean,
but there's no way b'thumping is a thing.

197
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:47,230
I'll get it!

198
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,316
You don't have to do everything
your little falafel pocket tells you to.

199
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,154
- You screwed up!
- Once! In 23 years!

200
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,071
I'll get 'em.

201
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:58,283
All these years I carried you,
when no one wanted to work with you.

202
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,285
I still managed to get you jobs.

203
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,370
And then you would flake,
or sabotage them,

204
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:06,249
or get wrapped up in some crisis
or emergency or vague sadness.

205
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,627
Everyone told me to dump you--
my bosses, film execs, directors,

206
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:12,505
they all told me you were washed up,
a nobody, a has-been,

207
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,884
- a joke, too portly for TV.
- Too portly for TV? Who said that?

208
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,719
- It doesn't matter.
- It does. Who said it?

209
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:22,098
- Luis Guzman.
- Luis Guzman said I'm too portly for TV?

210
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,517
You're right, BoJack.
This is for the best.

211
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,854
I no longer have to lug your talentless,
self-centered, self-sabotaging,

212
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,023
dead-weight carcass
of faded talent around my neck.

213
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,733
- Hey.
- Thank you for firing me.

214
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,319
I'm gonna go pour myself
a little celebratory potato juice,

215
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,238
because this is the best goddamn
thing that's ever happened to me.

216
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,908
Hey! Hey! Hey!

217
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:44,746
Ha, ha! I'll get it.

218
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,373
You do not talk to me like that
and walk away.

219
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,042
Oh, no? What's happening?

220
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,670
This is so weird. I'm walking away,
even though you told me not to.

221
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,589
Right, I don't work for you anymore.

222
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,841
- Hey!
- Excuse me, Mr. Horseman?

223
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:59,761
- Not now.
- We have a slight problem in the kitchen.

224
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,180
- Where is everybody?
- That's the problem. They all quit.

225
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,599
The kitchen's backed up with orders.
No one's getting food.

226
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,309
And the critic is growing very impatient.

227
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,979
Writing that down...

228
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,440
- Just do what you normally do.
- But there's no chef.

229
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,401
Tonight's your lucky night.
You just got promoted.

230
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:18,780
But I don't want to be a chef.
<i>♪ I want to sing ♪</i>

231
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:22,158
Kidding. I'm actually just happy
being a waiter. I'm not my job.

232
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,787
- A lot of people think that--
- You're the chef! Start cheffing!

233
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,704
Oh.

234
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:35,505
What? Fifty teeth?
Get out of here. Let me see.

235
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,590
-Ahh...
-Would you look at that.

236
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,592
You're thrilled
to have me out of your life?

237
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:43,096
- I was such a burden all those years.
- Can I close my mouth now?

238
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,014
- Know what I think?
- Don't wanna hear it.

239
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,641
You like being there to rescue me.

240
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:49,435
- I close my mouth, okay?
- Nobody cares!

241
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,229
- Okay--
- Nope, I'm still counting.

242
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,147
You like it when I'm a mess.

243
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,108
Because it makes you feel good
about yourself.

244
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,068
Guess what? I never asked for that.

245
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,695
You ask all the time.

246
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,197
You have never not been asking me
to rescue you.

247
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,074
"Princess Carolyn, help me!

248
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:06,452
I slept with the gaffer's wife
and now he's not lighting me properly.

249
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:10,039
Princess Carolyn, I threw up
on Elle Fanning in a bounce house.

250
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,959
Princess Carolyn,
why am I such a big stupid asshole?"

251
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,420
Okay, great, more abuse.
Right on schedule.

252
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:16,546
Oh, that's abuse?

253
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,589
"BoJack, you're such
a big, stupid asshole.

254
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:21,259
BoJack, why were you even
in the bounce house, dummy?

255
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,387
BoJack, you wasted my thirties!"

256
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,764
I never said you wasted my thirties.

257
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,599
Didn't have to, you're always saying it.

258
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:33,146
And I don't like being around you,
because I feel bad.

259
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,857
You make me feel bad.

260
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,901
So this isn't about me being a bad agent.

261
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,903
It's about a lot of things.

262
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,072
- Where are you going?
- Away.

263
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,741
Hey, listen, man.

264
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,994
I don't wanna get in the middle of this,
it's none of my business,

265
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,663
but I just have to say
I love that sweater.

266
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,582
- Can you give it to me?
- What? No.

267
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,792
I held my mouth open a really long time.

268
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:57,420
- What does that have to do--?
- You're not being fair,

269
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,172
to me or Princess Katniss.

270
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,423
- Who?
- Your friend.

271
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,509
You've forgotten her already?
Typical BoSchwack.

272
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:04,844
That's enough out of you.

273
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,388
It's all right,
you're gonna get through this.

274
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,849
- You're gonna get through this.
- Are you okay?

275
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,268
Are you okay?
You've been in there a long time.

276
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,228
I left for a while and came back.

277
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:17,023
Just so you know,
this wasn't an easy decision.

278
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,484
- This is the ladies' room!
- What's going on out there?

279
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,361
Are you watching a movie?

280
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,154
I agonized over this. Ask Ana.

281
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:26,824
- Oh. So you did talk about it with Ana.
- Yeah. I respect her opinion.

282
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:32,830
Paws not claws! Paws not claws!

283
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:35,124
Hey! Ow! God, you're strong.

284
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:47,220
This is exactly the kind of
unprofessionalism I'm talking about.

285
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:51,015
- You want to talk about professionalism?
- Yes, I do.

286
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,686
But not here.

287
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,109
You say you want professionalism?
Bullshit.

288
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,945
You want a mommy
you can slide your dick in.

289
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,322
I can want that
and also want professionalism.

290
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,200
A sex-mommy who keeps her boundaries,
is that too much to ask?

291
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,619
Is there a single woman
you've worked with

292
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,872
who you haven't tried
to groggily thrust yourself into?

293
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:17,583
Is it any wonder
I don't want to be around you?

294
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,919
All you do is tell me
I'm a terrible person.

295
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,922
Please, you're such
a self-pitying masochist,

296
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,550
I could say ten nice things
and one mean thing,

297
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,343
you would only hear the one mean thing.

298
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,679
I'd love it
if you said ten nice things to me.

299
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,682
- I can say nice things.
- Ready when you are.

300
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,726
Does self-pitying masochist count,
or are we starting from scratch?

301
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,271
Okay, one-- I'm freezing my whiskers off.

302
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:41,524
- You have a natural charisma.
- You hesitated, that means it's a lie.

303
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,526
Two, you are loved by millions.

304
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,446
That's not a compliment.
So is Kim Jong Un and Teri Hatcher.

305
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,030
I got this. I got this.

306
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,116
Pre-heat oven?
Where's the pre-heat button?

307
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,993
Excuse me? Waiter?

308
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,370
Where are my family's
double-fudge cheese pies?

309
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,747
I'm not your waiter anymore.
I'm the chef.

310
00:15:56,831 --> 00:16:00,626
- Then who's our waiter?
- Uh, you're the waiter now. Ta-da!

311
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,961
I can't be a waiter.

312
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,464
I have a very important
business meeting tomorrow.

313
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:08,050
You get someone else to do it.
I'm the chef and whatever I say goes!

314
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,470
Okay. Who gets these
soy balls and onion cubes?

315
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,054
Table eight.
Deliver those soy balls, soldier.

316
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,473
You got it, boss.

317
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,517
Number six.
You know how to make me laugh.

318
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:19,270
So I'm a clown to you?
Like Joe Pesci in <i>Home Alone?</i>

319
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,856
You recognize
you're being impossible, right?

320
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:26,444
- I don't know how you put up with me.
- I didn't put up with you, BoJack.

321
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,947
I liked being with you.
And I don't regret it.

322
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:32,617
I don't regret the trip to the Bahamas.

323
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,286
Or the bracelet you bought me
for my 38th birthday.

324
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,537
Or when my dad died

325
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:39,457
and you came to the funeral
with me and held my hand.

326
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,418
I'm doing this for both of us.
You understand?

327
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:45,963
- Did you ever love me? At all?
- I don't-- I'm not--

328
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:50,801
You know that I don't do
the whole love thing.

329
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:55,139
Either you end up hurting someone
or they hurt you. So, what's the point?

330
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:56,390
Yeah.

331
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,101
Ugh. This sucks. Ow.

332
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:02,104
I did this to myself. I do this to myself.

333
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,524
- Why do I do this to myself?
- I don't know.

334
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,567
Maybe if you're good at putting out fires,

335
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,778
you just run from fire to fire
and don't really think about--

336
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:13,407
Oh, God, I don't wanna be a chef!
I want to be not on fire!

337
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:17,078
- We gotta put out that fire!
- I hate Mondays!

338
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,666
I figured out
how to pre-heat the oven.

339
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,544
This night has been a disaster.

340
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:27,838
The good news is I got my kid
to prep my important meeting at work.

341
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:30,299
The bad news is
all the customers went home.

342
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,634
They didn't like the screaming

343
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,303
and felt like their food
was a little too "on fire".

344
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,681
- It's called a char, dumbshits.
- The critic's still here.

345
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,225
Oh, oh, oh!

346
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,561
She still wants her mushroom risotto.

347
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,565
I don't know how to make risotto.

348
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:46,691
I know how.

349
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,609
What are you doing? No, go home.

350
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:51,279
You're right. What am I doing?

351
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:52,613
All right.

352
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:56,325
Good luck.

353
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,791

00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,669

00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:26,939
Ugh.

361
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,943
Goddamn it.

362
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:34,655
How should I know?
Do I look like an expert in cooking oils?

363
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:37,325
We have to choose!
We're running out of time.

364
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:40,494
- Olive. You wanna use olive oil.
- What are you doing?

365
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:42,872
Let me do this.
You'll burn the place to the ground.

366
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:46,083
Fine. This isn't one of those things
where you save my ass

367
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,419
so I feel obligated to give you
your job back.

368
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:51,130
I know you have no sense
of obligation to me.

369
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:55,343
Ooh, slam. I'm sorry,
I'd rather not get involved.

370
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:57,511
- Can I get you some more water?
- Mmm.

371
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,597
You look lovely. It's a great blouse.

372
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,641
Mom, I wanna go home.

373
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:03,893
This is a very important night
for the restaurant.

374
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,480
How are we coming on the sales meeting?
Did you get the big conference room?

375
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:11,442
Winslow wants the big conference room
for his presentation to corporate.

376
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,528
You get back on that phone
and you get me that big room.

377
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:16,405
Okay, Mom.

378
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,659
The secret is stirring continuously.

379
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:22,161
Right, so that's the secret.

380
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,706
I'm gonna go roll some more soy balls.

381
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,209
- Thanks for your help.
- Sure.

382
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,169
How do you know how to do this?

383
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,296
Mom was a live-in maid for a rich family.

384
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,466
She had a little trouble
bending her elbow too much. Glug, glug.

385
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:39,929
So unless I wanted us to be on the street,
I had to cover for her, a lot.

386
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,766
That rich family loved Italian food
and champagne fountains.

387
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:47,061
And cocaine. And private jets.
And screaming at each other.

388
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,647
"Who threw my cocaine
in the champagne fountain?"

389
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,316
- So standard rich people stuff?
- I guess.

390
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,820
- How come you never told me that?
- I did.

391
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:56,737
Oh.

392
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,823
It's okay. I know
you never remember anything.

393
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,867
That's not true.
I remember the first time we met.

394
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:05,121
<i>I went to see Marv. You were</i>
<i>at the desk in front of his office.</i>

395
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,582
<i>I thought you were cute and you said,</i>
<i>"It's good to see you again."</i>

396
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:13,254
- Oh. So I guess we'd met before.
- That was the third time we met.

397
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:17,341
The first time was when I was an intern.
I delivered a script to your house.

398
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,137
<i>You were passed out in the yard,</i>
<i>covered in tapioca pudding.</i>

399
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,973
<i>I hosed you down, dragged you inside,</i>
<i>covered you with a blanket.</i>

400
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,600
- Really? I don't remember that.
- Shocker.

401
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:30,020
So you've gone from daughter of a maid
to head of your own company.

402
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:32,314
Well, the company's not doing so hot.

403
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,775
- Don't try to guilt me.
- It's not your fault.

404
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,154
Turns out being an agent and running
an agency are two different skills.

405
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,866
It's like asking a really delicious tomato
to make you a tomato sandwich.

406
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,744
How's a tomato gonna make you
a sandwich? He's got no arms.

407
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,538
You'll figure it out. Princess Carolyn
always lands on her feet.

408
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,916
But I don't even know why I'm doing it.
Does any of it matter?

409
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,003
Why are you an agent at all
if it makes you so miserable?

410
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,254
Because I'm good at it.

411
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:59,216
I mean, stuff hasn't been hitting lately.
But, usually, I'm really good at it.

412
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,844
Just 'cause you're good at something
doesn't mean you have to do it.

413
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,847
I'm good at driving sober,
but I don't relish the opportunity.

414
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,309
But what else would I do?
Who else would I be?

415
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,729
I do love you, by the way.

416
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:15,357
I mean, as much
as I'm capable of loving anyone.

417
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:18,486
Which is never enough. I'm sorry.

418
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,450
Ta-da!

419
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:33,501
Well, it is truly...

420
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:37,338
how should I put this? Wonderful.

421
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,632
So you'll give Elefante a good review?

422
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:44,762
Oh, no, I can't do that.
I waited over two hours to be served.

423
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:48,349
The ambience was terrible.
You two were screaming all night.

424
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,727
At one point, a waiter
ran through the restaurant on fire.

425
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:55,356
Unfortunately,
you will be receiving my lowest rating:

426
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:59,026
four hundred and twelve stars,
out of a possible a billion.

427
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,194
A billion stars?

428
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:04,323
Yes, that's the rubric I use on
SamanthaGoesToRestaurants.tumblr.com.

429
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,742
Oh, God, get out.

430
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:09,453
I assure you the animated GIFs

431
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:13,290
with which I describe this encounter
shall be scathing.

432
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:16,669
Mom! I just touched base
with Rooney, re: Winslow.

433
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:20,172
He's out, we're in.
The conference room is ours.

434
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:23,592
Perfect! This is the meeting
where we finally convince the big boys

435
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,636
to let us get babies addicted to vaping!

436
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,430
Yes! Corporation!

437
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,812
- How about a drink?
- I could drink.

438
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,897
I don't think I can. I'm heading out.

439
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:39,733
I got pretty badly burnt earlier
and in a lot of pain.

440
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,236
I should probably go to the ER.
Have a great night.

441
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:46,824
Ha, ha!

442
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,160
What's the second time we met?

443
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:53,706
- A taping of <i>Horsin' Around.</i>
- Which episode?

444
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,959
<i>The one where Olivia put too much</i>
<i>detergent in the washing machine.</i>

445
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,128
<i>Nancy Reagan was the guest star.</i>

446
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,672
<i>That woman</i>
<i>was the real actor in the family.</i>

447
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:05,843
<i>I just started working for Marv.</i>
<i>I went backstage to introduce myself.</i>

448
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:07,553
And then what happened?

449
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,472
You told me you were too tired
pretending to be nice all night,

450
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:13,058
- and I needed to leave you alone.
- Oh.

451
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:14,643
I'm a real jerk, huh?

452
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,021
Yeah, but you're honest,
straightforward,

453
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,315
not fake nice
and don't beat around the bush.

454
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,942
Your heart is tender,
so you protect it from people,

455
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:26,030
but sometimes you open up a wall
and it's incredible.

456
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:29,575
You're doing the best you can,
considering your asshole parents.

457
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,076
You have great taste in art,

458
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,079
and that pink spot
on your nose is just adorable.

459
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:36,081
How many nice things was that,
about ten?

460
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,584
- Yeah, just about.
- Okay, one more.

461
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,712
You let me help you tonight
because you knew I needed it.

462
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,632
You did it for me,
which was very sweet.

463
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:47,843
Thanks. You're a good friend to me.

464
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:50,554
- BoJack...
- Yeah?

465
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:51,889
Are we friends?

466
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:54,350
Yeah. I mean, I think we are.

467
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,393
Or I think we can be.

468
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:59,938
Okay, then as a friend, I'm asking you...

469
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:01,690
Please don't leave me.

470
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:03,275
- Princess Carolyn--
- Please.

471
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,070
I can turn this around,
I just need more time.

472
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,405
We're in a fragile period,
still finding our feet.

473
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:10,991
Just give me six months
and then you can go.

474
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:14,244
I promise,
I'll never ask anything from you again,

475
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:17,247
but please, give me six months.

476
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:19,500
Sorry, I left my coat here.

477
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:26,965
I got it.

478
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,517
So? What do you think?

479
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,102
