1
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,596
So, at the end of the day,

2
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:15,349
I'm just a regular guy trying
to live a regular life.

3
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:18,519
Remember that time you peed
in drew Barrymore's car?

4
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:21,605
Uh, yes, I remember that.
Why do you remember that?

5
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:23,148
It was in your book.

6
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:26,151
- You should do that to someone here.
- What? No.

7
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:29,863
Well, anyway, I can't believe
I'm on a date with bojack horseman.

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,158
I feel like that anonymous girl
from chapter 8 of your book

9
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:35,953
mixed with the pluck and determination
of that anonymous girl

10
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:39,206
- from chapter 12.
- We don't need to dwell on the past.

11
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,416
Wait, shut up.
Is this the restaurant you bought

12
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,503
when you were trying
to show up Mr. Peanutbutter?

13
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,256
- Uh".no.
- Hey, this table's a little wobbly.

14
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,341
Want to yell at the waiter
and make a scene?

15
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:51,843
- No, I don't need...
- Come on, do that bojack thing

16
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,346
where you make a big deal
and everyone laughs,

17
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:55,806
but at the same time we relate,

18
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:58,559
because you're saying
the things polite society won't.

19
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,725
That's not... uh...

20
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:03,313
- Is everything all right over here?
- No, everything is not all right.

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,357
This table's been wobbling all evening.

22
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:08,860
If I wanted to flop around and get seasick
for an hour, I'd call your mother.

23
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,822
- Something in that area or...?
- Take me home now

24
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:15,450
and don't let me get out of bed
until I turn horse-colored.

25
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,954
- What are you doing?
- Did you want me to stay?

26
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:20,872
No, I wanted you to leave more quietly.

27
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,417
Some of us here are trying
to forget you exist.

28
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,711
"Forget you exist."
Classic bojack. Love it.

29
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:30,549
- Oh, my god, are you Todd?
- Uh, yes.

30
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:31,925
"Shut up, Todd!"

31
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,429
Aw, okay.

32
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,656
Hey, Todd, can you drive me
to get my car?

33
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,533
I wanted to be responsible last night,
so I ubered home

34
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,786
- and left my car in the fountain.
- Sorry, bojack.

35
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:46,291
I gotta get ready for my grand opening.
It's finally happening. My Disneyland.

36
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,544
I realize that by saying "what"
I might set off a chain of events

37
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,214
whereby we continue this conversation,
but what?

38
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,883
Well, remember when I first moved in
and I kept asking

39
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,177
- if we could go to Disneyland?
- I do not.

40
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,721
And then you said
that there was no Disneyland.

41
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,599
- No.
- That Disneyland was a made-up lie,

42
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:06,144
like the tooth fairy, that parents use
to get their kids to behave.

43
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,689
- Oh, yeah, that shut you up.
- Sure did.

44
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:12,317
But then I thought,
why isn't there a Disneyland?

45
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:13,527
People would love it!

46
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,779
So, I took matters into my own hands,

47
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:19,574
and over the last five years,
I built my own Disneyland.

48
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:23,245
You've been doing this for five years?
How have you never mentioned it?

49
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:27,332
I bought that cheap plot of non-arable
dirt by the toxic waste dump

50
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:30,293
- up the hill from the old fire station.
- Okay, Todd.

51
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,380
- I'm gonna build a Disneyland.
- Sounds great, champ.

52
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,882
If it wasn't for that,
she wouldn't have gotten sober.

53
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,636
Just finished drawing up blueprints
for that Disneyland I'm building.

54
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:40,929
Kind of busy here, Todd.

55
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,682
So, it turned out to be a good thing
I peed in her car.

56
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:45,684
Sorry for all the noise.

57
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:49,646
Got this crew of worker bees
to help me build my Disneyland.

58
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:53,316
Okay, I get it. You are building
your own Disneyland.

59
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:57,446
- Literally the first I'm hearing of this.
- Anyway, tomorrow we open the gates.

60
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:01,867
Finally, people will have a place to go
after they win the super bowl.

61
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,411
But you do know
that there already is a Disneyland?

62
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,497
- Yeah, I built it.
- No, I mean the real Disneyland.

63
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,584
You mean, the one in the hearts
and minds of children everywhere?

64
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,462
- The one in anaheim!
- I think we're saying the same thing.

65
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,838
Are we?

66
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:20,552
Well, I think it's safe
to take the cone off.

67
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,929
I can do it for a small co-pay.

68
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,473
Can't say I'll miss it,

69
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,852
but we did have some crazy adventures
together these last few weeks.

70
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,940
Honey, would you rub my chin for me
so I can remember things?

71
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,942
Oh, um, okay. Uh...

72
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,570
Yeah, memories.

73
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:41,782
Hey, where should we go for my first meal
after the operation?

74
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,576
It's not an operation,
but we could go to storky's again.

75
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:47,788
Oh, yeah! We're finally due
for our free sub.

76
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:51,333
"Storky's,
where your 815t sandwich is free.“

77
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,628
we've been there 80 times?
It just opened last month.

78
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:58,465
Yeah, but you love it, so whenever
you suggest it, I always say yes.

79
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,259
Yeah, but 80 times?

80
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,180
Well, that'll be $6000.

81
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,974
Good thing you're getting
a free sandwich, huh?

82
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,187
What the...?

83
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:15,690
Huh?

84
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:20,153
Okay, you guys.
You vultures are killing me!

85
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,697
I'm sure he's talking about
other vultures.

86
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:27,327
Ah, the valley.

87
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,205
Because sometimes you wanna go
where no one knows your name.

88
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:34,209
- Bojack horseman!
- Pinky? Hey, how are you?

89
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:36,920
Oh, great!

90
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,797
- How's the book biz?
- Who knows?

91
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:42,843
I jumped off that burning ship.
Print media? What a joke.

92
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,263
Now I got a job
in broadcast network television,

93
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:50,600
a booming industry
with nowhere to go but up.

94
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:51,852
Oh, god.

95
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,688
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, my boss loves this place.

96
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,815
Do you know Wanda Pierce?

97
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:59,860
Wanda just got named head
of programming at mbn.

98
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,403
We're here to celebrate.

99
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,489
Well, that and she just woke up
from a 30-year coma.

100
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,825
Wait, she just got out
of a 30-year coma

101
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:10,245
and she's the head of programming
at a major broadcast network?

102
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:14,374
She's been with the company 30 years.
Everyone above her kept getting fired.

103
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,710
Besides, she's got
some really fresh ideas.

104
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,671
I am really feeling
the kirk Cameron show.

105
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:22,757
I don't even need a pilot.
Let's just order 22 episodes.

106
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:27,304
How about a new show
where celebrities try to guess

107
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,972
whether or not people have talent?

108
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,682
We'll air it three nights a week.

109
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,937
Okay, what if we got relevant superstar
David Copperfield

110
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:39,441
to make
the world trade center disappear?

111
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,986
I hate to be the one to tell you this,

112
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:46,531
but David Copperfield really isn't
a big draw anymore.

113
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:48,909
Actually, everything feels fresh

114
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,620
if you just forget
the last 30 years ever happened.

115
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:52,786
Huh.

116
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,673
And here's a special request.

117
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,100
I've never even heard of this song,

118
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,919
but let's give it a spin:
“Special feeling."

119
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,631
Wanda, meet
the one and only bojack horseman.

120
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,090
- Who?
- Bojack.

121
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,759
- Who?
- Bojack horseman.

122
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,928
Is that name supposed
to mean something to me?

123
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,728
- Do you want to go skate?
- Nah. You know what they say,

124
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:19,606
you can lead a horse to roller,
but you can't make him rink.

125
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,777
- What?
- That's really funny.

126
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,070
- You're funny.
- Really?

127
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,405
Oh, my god. You should be on TV,

128
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,699
Which, holy shit, they're flat now.

129
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:33,203
Actually, I was on. You know what,
I'm sick of talking about me.

130
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,580
Let's talk about you.

131
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,755
Next thing I know,
I'm waking up from a 30-year coma.

132
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:47,092
So, now I'm sleeping on my sister's couch,
but it's not ideal.

133
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,928
She's molting.
You know how sisters are.

134
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:53,598
Oh, jeez, got a couple curly guys in here
with the regulars.

135
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,434
How hard is it to look
before they bring it out?

136
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,770
- Excuse me, miss?
- I know, isn't it cool?

137
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:01,064
- Like we're getting away with something.
- What?

138
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:04,442
Don't you love it when appetizers have
a little crossover episode?

139
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,237
It's like when you're watching
happy days and mork shows up.

140
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,822
Oh, yeah, I guess.

141
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,949
Or like when Kramer was
on Murphy brown.

142
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:14,536
- Who?
- Hey, you want to get out of here?

143
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:22,127
I don't want mbn to just be another boring
old network, you know what I mean?

144
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,212
- Yes, totally.
- I want to take risks.

145
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:28,425
I want to swing for the fences, you know?
Otherwise, what are we doing?

146
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,428
Oh, my god, is it morning?
We stayed up all night talking,

147
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,597
- and we didn't even have sex.
- Well, it's not too late.

148
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,764
Oh!

149
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,856
- That was fantastic.
- Oh, yes.

150
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,942
Of course, I haven't had sex in 30 years.
I hope.

151
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,569
- Something's wrong.
- What is it?

152
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:50,947
I don't know, I feel weird, like I want
to spend more time with you

153
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,867
- even though I know we just had sex.
- Okay.

154
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,201
No, you don't understand.

155
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:58,788
We already had sex,
but I still want to spend time with you.

156
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:03,001
Is that normal? Am I normal?
What is happening to me?

157
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,794
We can spend more time together.

158
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:10,175
I want to do things with you.
Fully clothed, sober, in daylight hours.

159
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,510
- Okay.
- I don't understand these feelings.

160
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:16,681
Let's get food? Or walk in park? Or...

161
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,476
Oh, god, it's coming. I can't stop it.

162
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:23,563
- Do you want to go to Disneyland?
- Okay.

163
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:37,035
Disneyland has a lot more sparking wires
and loose nails than I remember.

164
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:39,954
Please hold your questions
until the end of the tour.

165
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:43,917
Here we have
Mr. Todd's wild death-coaster.

166
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,211
The name is a work in progress,

167
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,714
but we wanted to work "death"
into the title for liability reasons.

168
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:54,928
And this is Gabe Jr.,
the grease fire of the Caribbean.

169
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:59,933
- This is boring. I want to go home.
- Vincent, be nice!

170
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,727
He's a little cranky
because he just got adult braces.

171
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:06,940
- You mean, braces.
- Princess Carolyn, stop embarrassing me!

172
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:13,655
And here we have cinderella's
magical pile of used mattresses.

173
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:14,822
Help!

174
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,866
Is it a good idea
to keep all those mattresses

175
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:21,079
- so close to an active grease fire?
- Where's your sense of wonder, Diane?

176
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:24,958
- Your friend is really negative.
- Yeah, don't be so negative, Diane.

177
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,835
- What?
- You know I hate negativity.

178
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:30,672
I mean, I don't hate it because
that's also negative, but you know.

179
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:38,930
- Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.
- Hey, buddy, this place is amazing.

180
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:42,100
It's like some sort of Disney version
of knott's Berry farm.

181
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,686
Oh, that's exactly
what I was going for!

182
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,396
I can't wait to get involved

183
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:49,566
and really spray the old
Mr. Peanutbutter scent on everything.

184
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:54,821
Ahh, I was sort of thinking of this
as kind of just my thing.

185
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:59,200
Well, technically, you did build this
while working for p.B. Livin,

186
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,704
so I have the blah-blah-blah
of first refusal or whatever.

187
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,497
Oh, uh, okay.

188
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,207
I mean, that's just good business.

189
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,794
We're in this together now, Todd,
and nothing will distract me from...

190
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:13,673
Erica! You can't be here.
This place is filled with children.

191
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:19,012
Coach said he saw you headed
to the visitor's locker room

192
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,305
with a steel pipe.

193
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:23,183
You really think I'm the guy
who busted that pinto's leg?

194
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:27,061
'Cause if I am, you should be
a lot more goddamn scared of me.

195
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:31,482
Hey! My girlfriend's here.
Look, everyone! I have a girlfriend!

196
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:32,984
Sure. We'll cut there.

197
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,653
The middle of your line
is as good a place as any.

198
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,947
- What are you doing here?
- Just wanted to stop by.

199
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,950
We're filming hey, I think you can
dance! On the next stage.

200
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,119
Look at you, all professional.

201
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:46,247
Like Natalie Portman in that movie
where she was a professional.

202
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,666
Who? People are watching.

203
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,920
The first time bojack dates a woman
his own age,

204
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,088
she's basically just
a stunted 20-year-old.

205
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,925
Well, bojack's stunted, too.
He got famous in his twenties,

206
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,718
so he'll be
in his twenties forever.

207
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,221
After you get famous,
you don't have to keep growing.

208
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,848
Every celebrity has
an age of stagnation.

209
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,350
I'm glad I never got famous.

210
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:08,728
I mean, I did write a best-selling book,
but I'm not famous-famous.

211
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,772
Oh it doesn't just happen
when you get famous.

212
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,982
Your age of stagnation
is when you stop growing.

213
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,818
For most, it's when they get married,
settle into a routine.

214
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,071
You meet someone
who loves you unconditionally

215
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,907
and never challenges you
or wants you to change,

216
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,909
and then you never change.

217
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:26,204
But mostly it's just the famous people,
right?

218
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,669
Stella! Stella!

219
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,045
Corona light.

220
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,172
This place is incredible.

221
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,341
I wanted to make you feel at home,

222
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:41,886
and nothing was bigger in the '805
than '505 nostalgia.

223
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:46,015
It really feels like I'm back in the '805,
feeling like I'm back in the '505.

224
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:49,310
It's like if back to the future
and Peggy sue got married got married.

225
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,229
Okay, teenyboppers,

226
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:54,315
let's take things back
to the '505, '505 style,

227
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:58,486
with this classic '505 hit
that everybody remembers:

228
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,739
"I just met my perfect match."

229
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,125
Wanda, these last few days
have been so amazing.

230
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,168
You've given me a fresh start.

231
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:17,714
In fact, it almost feels like
I just woke up from a 30-year coma.

232
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,717
I'm sorry, did you say you just woke up
from a 30-year coma?

233
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,177
- Oh, no, not me. Her.
- That's insane.

234
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,013
I just woke up from a 30-year coma.

235
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,683
Whoa!
Sorry about that needle skip, folks.

236
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:32,228
Let's start that song again
from the beginning.

237
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,695
I'm Alex.

238
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,613
- Wanda.
- And I'm bojack.

239
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,158
You know it's been really tough for me
these last few weeks.

240
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:49,037
I've never seen home alone and everyone
makes me feel like a freak because of it.

241
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,603
- You've never seen home alone?
- I've never seen home alone!

242
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:54,792
- Also, I don't really know what a dvr is.
- Neither do I!

243
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:59,172
- No one does. It's just a magic box.
- Wanda, we have so much in common.

244
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,548
Really it's just one thing.

245
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:04,028
You can't count each individual thing you
missed as a different thing you have in common.

246
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,471
That's like saying I have a lot
in common with kanye west

247
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,197
because we both breathe air constantly.

248
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,516
Who? Jinx. Buy me a coke zero.

249
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,685
What's a coke zero?
I have no idea.

250
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:17,273
We gotta hang out more. I didn't know
there was anyone else like me.

251
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,401
Give me your fax and pager number
so I can add them to my rolodex.

252
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,611
Tubular.

253
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:27,241
I don't trust that guy.
I bet he's seen home alone.

254
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:30,244
Bojack, I'm starting to lose
the thread of your character.

255
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:34,082
You think you can drop the jealous
boyfriend routine? It feels a little done.

256
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,417
You're right, I'm sorry.
Call me snoop dogg

257
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,587
- because I will drop it like it's hot.
- Bojack, I don't...

258
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:43,633
I got that one! Snoopy the dog.
From "peanuts." Okay.

259
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,432
I got here as fast as I could.

260
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,143
Where's this next Haley Joel osment
you were telling me about?

261
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,437
- Oh that was a lie to get you here.
- Aw, fish.

262
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:59,649
- There's never a next Haley Joel osment.
- And there never will be.

263
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:02,568
Sorry I tricked you, but with Todd
running his own Disneyland

264
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,570
and actress margo martindale
in prison

265
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,737
for some reason I don't remember,
you're the best friend I've got right now.

266
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:11,160
Now grab the binoculars. I need dirt
on Wanda's new gentleman friend.

267
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,246
No, bojack. What's the play here?

268
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,540
You'll find one little imperfection
and harp on it

269
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,083
like you do with my boyfriend?

270
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,002
You do understand what my “thing" is
with your boyfriend?

271
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,422
You'll just push her
into this other guy's arms.

272
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:26,092
Wanda likes you. Why ruin that?

273
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,471
This is comrade Alexander
calling kgb high command.

274
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,765
It's been two weeks since I woke up,

275
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,309
and I still have not been contacted
by my handlers.

276
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:38,646
I am awaiting orders to take down
the American dogs and pigs

277
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:42,108
and other various animals and humans.
Come in, kgb high command.

278
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:46,237
Slap my salami, the guy's a commie.

279
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,785
Hey, what's going on here?

280
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:56,205
You've been served
with a cease-and-desist from my clients,

281
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,707
the Walt Disney company.

282
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:01,085
I wanted to make sure what we were
doing here was 100 percent legal,

283
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,045
- so I called a lawyer.
- Wait, what?

284
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:06,466
As it turns out, it's not legal at all.
Who knew?

285
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:10,219
- Mr. Peanutbutter.
- We'll see you in court.

286
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,681
- The food court?
- No. Regular court.

287
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:19,020
Okay. But also I'm hungry, so I might
just stop by the food court first.

288
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:25,776
Let the record show, this is the single
dumbest case I've ever adjudicated.

289
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:28,029
- Mr. Chavez?
- Okay.

290
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:29,655
I'm just gonna throw this out there.

291
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:34,243
Is it possible maybe when the other guys
tried to copyright the name Disneyland,

292
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,537
they wrote down something else
by mistake,

293
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,998
so Disneyland is still up for grabs?

294
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:44,545
Okay, well, let's have a look
at the articles of incorporation to see

295
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:49,383
if Walt Disney accidentally trademarked
the wrong name. I'm sure these...

296
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:54,514
- What?
- There's a typo. Di'isneyland.

297
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:59,101
With two I's. That son of a gun
trademarked the wrong name.

298
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,270
May I, counselor?

299
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,690
D-i-i-s. This is unambiguous.

300
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,444
- I find in favor of the defendant.
- Aw, shit.

301
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:11,113
- You're the defendant.
- Aw, sweet!

302
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,825
Your otter, this is a gross miscarriage
of justice.

303
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:17,745
Hooray! Gross miscarriage!

304
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:27,046
And that's how I turned my dream into
what I call “the happiest place on urf."

305
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:30,424
Urf is a made-up magical kingdom
I added to the Disney canon.

306
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:34,178
- Americans, they like this theme park?
- Oh, they love it.

307
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,347
It represents everything
america stands for.

308
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:40,309
- I mean, yeah.
- We did it, buddy!

309
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,478
Actually, I did it.

310
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:48,818
I had the idea to build a park,
I did all the work and I beat the lawsuit.

311
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:54,240
- Well, there's no I in "team," right?
- But there is an I in "Disneyland."

312
00:17:54,407 --> 00:18:00,204
And unlike that other Disneyland,
this Disneyland only has one I.

313
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:01,455
What are you saying?

314
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:04,333
You're not welcome
at my theme park anymore.

315
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,338
There's only room for one goofy dog there
and his name is pluto.

316
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,631
Todd, no.

317
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,594
I've told the bees
if they see you to sting you on sight.

318
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,390
You understand. It's nothing personal.
It's just good business.

319
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:21,809
And that's how we do business on urf.

320
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:26,272
- I don't like you like this.
- I learned it from you.

321
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,399
If I could get everyone's attention.

322
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:31,527
You're probably wondering
why I invited you all here tonight.

323
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:34,196
You said it was to celebrate
Todd's legal victory.

324
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,282
Right, but obviously
I don't care about that,

325
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,409
so you're probably wondering
the real reason.

326
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:41,078
No, we just took you at face value.

327
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,164
We have a special guest here tonight.

328
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:46,417
Alex. Or should I say “comrade"?

329
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:52,089
- Why would you say “comrade"?
- Oh, I forgot to explain that part.

330
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,718
Alex is a kgb agent
bent on destroying america.

331
00:18:57,053 --> 00:19:00,514
- It truly is a small world after all!
- Alex, is that true?

332
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,351
Okay, yes. It's true.

333
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:06,771
I was a deep-cover kgb operative
before I went into my coma.

334
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:09,357
I've been trying to contact
my handler in Russia,

335
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,318
but I can't reach him
and I don't know if I ever will.

336
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:13,485
Aww!

337
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,030
No! He's... it's not adorable!

338
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:20,034
He's a Soviet sleeper-agent
who doesn't realize the cold war is over.

339
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:22,620
I felt totally alone in this world
before I met Wanda.

340
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:25,456
And then I met all of you, my friends.

341
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,249
But if you're kicking me to the curb

342
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,669
just because I think
you're all capitalist swine

343
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:33,130
and want to see your way
of life destroyed, well, so be it.

344
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:38,010
- Or should I say, so-vi-et.
- Oh! Cute. Wordplay.

345
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,389
- That's not even good wordplay.
- Wait, how did you know all this?

346
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:45,476
- Bojack, were you spying on him?
- He is literally a spy

347
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:48,354
trying to destroy america,
the country we all live in.

348
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:49,605
How am I the bad guy here?

349
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:53,693
Bojack, I am really bumping on
the whole you-not-liking-Alex of it all.

350
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,362
- You told me you were going to drop it.
- Yeah, but...

351
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,114
I don't care about Alex.

352
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,282
I want to know what happened
to the amazing guy

353
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,577
I spent the last few days with,
because if this is who you are,

354
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,246
I don't think I like it.

355
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:07,540
Alex, would you take me back
to my sister's place?

356
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:10,418
Sure thing, Wanda.
And I can get you there fast

357
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,086
because I'm always Russian.

358
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:13,253
Aww!

359
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:14,422
Seriously?

360
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:23,305
I got here as fast as I could.
Where's the next Dakota fa...?

361
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,890
Oh, I get what happened.

362
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:28,060
Could you get me a beer from the fridge?
I didn't want to stand up.

363
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,479
Wait, no. I don't deserve beer.

364
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,357
So you called me all the way over here
to not get you a beer?

365
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:36,694
Why do I always do this?
I push away everyone I care about.

366
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,821
Oh, do you? I never noticed that.

367
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:41,741
Look, you obviously really care
about this girl

368
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,452
and that scares you,
so you sabotage yourself.

369
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,413
That's my problem.
I'm too good at sabotage.

370
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,375
- Why am I so good at everything I do?
- Hey, I got a crazy idea.

371
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:54,628
How about you just stop sulking
and go win her back, dummy?

372
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:58,591
You're right. I gotta win her back,
put it all on the line. You know what?

373
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,343
I think I will have that beer,
can you get it for me?

374
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,972
- Why do I bother?
- Hey, grab a beer for yourself, too!

375
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:06,766
Actually, I want both beers!

376
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:15,900
- Wanda.
- What do you want, bojack?

377
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,943
There's something I gotta say.
When I was...

378
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,697
- Todd! There's something I gotta say!
- Hey, I'm kind of already doing this.

379
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,492
I never should have tried
to make your thing my thing!

380
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:28,537
I just got excited and wanted to smear
Mr. Peanutbutter all over everything.

381
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:32,041
I should have been supporting you,
like this support beam.

382
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:37,797
- Or a different support beam.
- It's my fault.

383
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:41,550
The point of Disneyland isn't
to make money and win lawsuits.

384
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:42,802
But I forgot that.

385
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:46,931
So, these two were so consumed
by greed that it destroyed them.

386
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,517
You know, I came here today
to blow up Disneyland.

387
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,310
- You what?
- But now I realize,

388
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,354
I don't need to take down capitalism.

389
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:56,106
Capitalism sows the seeds
for its own destruction.

390
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:59,443
It's a snake that eats itself.
It's only a matter of time.

391
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,072
Hey, buddy, let's just say we... oh!

392
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:06,909
Oh, no, no, no. No!

393
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,702
Gabe Jr.!

394
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,663
Quick, Todd! The mattress pile!

395
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,791
Jump to safety! No!

396
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,794
Bees, help!
Your queen commands you!

397
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:25,052
No! Bees! Come on!

398
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,765
- You gotta... over the...
- What is it, boy? What's wrong?

399
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:33,811
- Hey, there's trouble.
- Did some kid fall down a well?

400
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:35,354
No, no, no! Listen.

401
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,523
He's trying to tell us
a kid fell down a well.

402
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,609
- Let's go, go, go! Come on!
- Bad, bad, bad. You gotta...

403
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,070
No, no, no, listen!

404
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,282
Wait, Wanda, we need to talk.

405
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,450
- But the fire.
- I don't care about that.

406
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:51,537
Look, the great guy you've been
getting to know, that's me.

407
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,497
That other guy,
the guy from the party,

408
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:57,585
that's me too and you need
to know that. I'm not perfect.

409
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:01,380
I'm cynical and I'm possessive
and I can sometimes fly off the handle.

410
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:04,675
I'm not always the best
at being not terrible.

411
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:07,052
I gotta say,
I'm not loving this pitch so far.

412
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,763
But I want to be better,
I'm trying to be better.

413
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,474
And when I'm around you,
for the first time in 30 years,

414
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,976
I feel like I can be.

415
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:16,478
Wanda, you make me want
to be a better man.

416
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,606
Wow. That's a great line.

417
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:21,400
- Did you just come up with that?
- Yes.

418
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:24,862
Hey, boys and girls,
this is your park dj speaking.

419
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:27,865
And as the Titanic's band played on
as the ship sank,

420
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:33,078
so too will I spin one last record
as my dj booth is engulfed in flames.

421
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:57,978
Hooray!

422
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,361
Mr. Peanutbutter.

423
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:06,904
- You saved me!
- No.

424
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,949
I saved us.

425
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:15,871
- I want to give this a real shot.
- I don't know, bojack.

426
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:18,874
I just got out of my coma,
and I don't have time to waste

427
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,918
if you're still figuring your shit out.

428
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:23,879
Plus, it's hard to think straight
with this fire everywhere.

429
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:25,798
- Move in with me.
- What?

430
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,050
I know it feels fast.
We barely know each other.

431
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:30,761
It's crazy, but I like you.

432
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:33,973
And sometimes you gotta swing
for the fences, right?

433
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,975
- Okay.
- Yeah?

434
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:39,103
Yeah. Let's move in together.
Let's do it.

435
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:41,939
It's crazy, but let's do it!

436
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:47,277
J“ back in the '905 j“

437
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:52,950
j“ I was in a very famous TV show j“

438
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,620
j“ -I'm bojack the horse

439
00:24:56,787 --> 00:25:01,792
j“ bojack the horse

00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:07,881
j' and I'm trying to hold onto my past j'

j“ that I'm a horse and a man j"

444

446
