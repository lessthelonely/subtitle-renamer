1
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,969
- We're live in five minutes, folks.
- Make way.

2
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:14,097
Someone find out the average rainfall
in bora bora.

3
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:15,599
Thank you so much for doing this.

4
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:17,392
Hey, there are a lot of advantages to

5
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,353
being the girlfriend of a
big celebrity.

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,771
It's more than being an elbow

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,249
they couldn't crop out of
a red-carpet shot in us weekly.

8
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:26,068
- I've been that elbow.
- Hello, what have we here?

9
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:28,070
So you know
how the game's played, right?

10
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:30,113
I'm sure I'll pick it up.
How hard could it be?

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,200
You didn't read the treatment?
I faxed it to you.

12
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:34,701
My bad, our fax machine
isn't plugged in.

13
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,578
Bojack, this is our first show

14
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:39,498
and it is very important that things
run smoothly tonight.

15
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:41,542
I mean, do you even care
about this at all?

16
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:45,254
Sweetie, no. I think this is stupid
and a waste of everybody's time.

17
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,548
But you're my girlfriend
and I care about you.

18
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,092
- So I'm here.
- Okay. Break a leg.

19
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:53,637
Me, me, me. My, my, my.
Bow-wow-wow-wow.

20
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:56,014
Good boy, good boy.

21
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,517
Okay, this is it, everybody.
Moment of truth.

22
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,310
Now it's in the hands of god.

23
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:03,564
And for the next 30 minutes,
I am that god.

24
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,816
- I got you an iPad, ma'am.
- Oh, no thanks, Mia.

25
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:09,027
I'm still working my way through
the last 30 years of technology.

26
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,320
Right now I'm on palm pilot.

27
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,031
But you can use our second screen app
to see what viewers say

28
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,283
about the show as it airs.

29
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:18,161
0h, cool,
I love stupid bullshit like this. Ooh.

30
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,328
Oh, you just touch it.

31
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:24,376
Hello, I am mustache Todd.
Like regular Todd, but with a mustache.

32
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:28,463
Listen boo-boo, I didn't graduate first in
my class from a prestigious university,

33
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,216
rise through the ranks at
an elite news organization,

34
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:33,802
win a well-known award,
never ever be sick at sea

35
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,848
and also my name is Mia mckibben,
so that I could deal with your nonsense.

36
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,058
Todd, stay out of hair and makeup.

37
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,226
But I like it there.

38
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:44,187
They brush my hair and tell me stories
about their weekends.

39
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:47,399
Big-nosed Todd wasn't funny,
zombie Todd wasn't funny,

40
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:49,234
pretty lady Todd wasn't funny,

41
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,445
and this isn't funny.
No more tomfoolery.

42
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:54,197
When it's me,
we call it "Todd-foolery."

43
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,366
We certainly do not call it that.

44
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,533
Listen up, everyone.

45
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,661
What you are part of tonight
is bigger than you.

46
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,163
It's bigger than any of us.

47
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,873
I expect all of you to work together.

48
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,168
But I also expect that one of you
will tower above the rest.

49
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:11,590
And that outstanding individual
will receive this pen.

50
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:14,134
It was through this pen that I bled

51
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:17,596
raise high the roof beam,
carpenters upon the page.

52
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:19,389
Also, it has four different colors.

53
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,225
Black, red, blue
and for some reason, green.

54
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,477
By the end of tonight,

55
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:27,439
this pen will be bestowed upon
the person most deserving.

56
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:30,192
Because nothing is more
important than television,

57
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:33,945
and no one more important than
the people who make that television.

58
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:38,158
- Now, let's get to work.
- And five, four,

59
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:41,578
- three, two...
- Showtime.

60
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:42,305
Live from the historic
studio 60 on the sunset strip,

61
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,640
jd. Salinger presents:

62
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:46,643
Hollywoo stars and celebrities,
what do they know?

63
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,688
Do they know things?
Let's find out!

64
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:54,776
Ah. All right! Here we go.

65
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:55,943
Listen to that crowd.

66
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,029
If they lose it this much
for Mr. Peanutbutter,

67
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,782
can you imagine what they're going to
do for a real celebrity?

68
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:04,244
Hey, this is Mr. Peanutbutter's show,
so be nice.

69
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,329
When you say nice, do you mean kind?

70
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,290
Or, like,
delivering a lot of sick burns,

71
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,709
so that people in the audience go,
"nice."

72
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,462
The first one. Obviously the first one.

73
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,797
Tonight we answer the age-old question:

74
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,759
"Hollywoo stars and celebrities,
what do they know?

75
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,386
Do they know things?
Let's find out!"

76
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,348
And now our first-ever guest.

77
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,768
You know him from his years on
horsin ' around,

78
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,603
his drunk appearance on the view,

79
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:34,024
and his bestselling book,
it's bojack horseman.

80
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,903
There you are. How are you doing?

81
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,280
- Bojack, welcome.
- It is great to be here.

82
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,824
Sorry, no time for idle chit chat,
because we've entered

83
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,993
- the small talk round.
- The what now?

84
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,499
Thirty seconds on the clock.
Bojack, how are you?

85
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,876
- Uh, flne?
- Correct.

86
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:55,104
- Did you see the game last night?
- No, I don't follow...

87
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,448
Oh.

88
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,882
Oh, so sorry.
It says here you did see the game.

89
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,736
- What game?
- Ready camera one? Camera one.

90
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,428
You tell me.
You're the one who saw it.

91
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:04,781
I don't...

92
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,682
God, no!

93
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,129
- What the...?
- That noise means

94
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,728
it's time for your first
general knowledge question.

95
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,689
Audience, does bojack know things?

96
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,108
Let's find out!

97
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:20,862
Bojack, what is the average
annual rainfall in bora bora?

98
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,658
- Uh, this is general knowledge?
- It's just an average we're asking for.

99
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:28,286
- I don't know, seven?
- Wrong! So wrong.

100
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,871
Wow, when it comes to bora bora,

101
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,458
maybe this celebrity should
have studied more-a more-a.

102
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,378
Yes, Mr. Peanutbutter. Go for the kill.

103
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,797
- That doesn't really seem...
- They're all dead!

104
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,841
I watched them die!

105
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,634
- What is...?
- Oh-ho. That sound means

106
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,469
it's time to pick your category.

107
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:50,433
"Trigonometry." "advanced physics,"
and "at the movies with Mr. Peanutbutter."

108
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,310
At the movies with
Mr. Peanutbutter.

109
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:56,731
Good choice. After seeing j.J. Abrams'
Star Trek reboot, did I call it:

110
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,942
A, “a visual feast for the senses,"

111
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,862
b, "a zestful lark through time
and space,"

112
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:05,031
c, "the best Zachary quinto movie
of all time,"

113
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,450
or d, "all of the above"?

114
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:11,580
- I'll say d?
- Ouch, the answer was a and b.

115
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,039
Though I would
also agree with c.

116
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,376
So I told Mr. Peanutbutter
I'd drive him here,

117
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,337
and next thing I know,
I'm an associate producer.

118
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,631
Stupid me. I went to Stanford.

119
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,467
Next time I'll just try that
thing where I'm a huge dumb-ass

120
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,678
who happens to be friends
with Mr. Peanutbutter.

121
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:27,679
- Yup.
- Cool.

122
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,598
Well, have fun watching me
win that pen.

123
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:30,764
I don't need a pen.

124
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:35,562
I can walk into any chili's with a child
under 12 and get crayons for free.

125
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:36,897
You don't get it.

126
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,774
If salinger gives you his pen,
that means you're worth something.

127
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,694
It means you're a serious person
who's going places.

128
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:46,698
Actually, you know what?
Don't worry about it. It's not for you.

129
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,452
I'm gonna go with nuclear fusion.

130
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,871
Oh, the answer is Egypt.

131
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,707
Turn up the directional heat lamps.
Oh, yeah.

132
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:58,418
Let's really make him sweat.

133
00:06:58,585 --> 00:06:59,961
Surprised you didn't get that one,

134
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:03,757
since you're an expert
when it comes to de-nile.

135
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,676
Quick impression.
"I'm not an alcoholic."

136
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,845
You love it.

137
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:12,933
Oh, yeah, pretty good one from king mutt
over here. Am I right?

138
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,518
You know, like king tut?

139
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,897
Because we're talking about Egypt?
And Mr. Peanutbutter's a mutt, so...

140
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,441
You suck.

141
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:22,901
I'm a yellow lab, bojack.

142
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:25,904
You could get one thing right tonight.

143
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,949
Anyway, let's take a moment
to look at the great comments

144
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,034
we've been getting on
our second screen app,

145
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,535
now available for download.

146
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,913
And we're out.
Fifteen seconds, everybody.

147
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,457
- Hey, how am I doing?
- You're kind of being a dick.

148
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,417
Hey, are we at Tony roma's right now?

149
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,628
Because there's a lot
of ribbing going on here.

150
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,672
I'm not ribbing you.
I'm telling you, you're...

151
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:47,634
And we're back in three, two...

152
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:48,801
Welcome back.

153
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:52,722
Will bojack horseman go down in show
history as our worst contestant ever?

154
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,599
So far, yes.

155
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,228
Wow. J.D., people are loving this show.

156
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:03,024
Wait until they see this.
Mia, get ready to drop the bomb.

157
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,151
Death from above!

158
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:09,698
Uh-oh. That sound means it's time
to drop "da" bomb.

159
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,866
And yes folks, I said "da," not "the."

160
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,244
What I'm trying to say is,
it's a positive bomb.

161
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,954
Audience, let's...

162
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,540
Drop da bomb!

163
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:21,251
Did you guys all practice
before the show, because...

164
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:26,006
Ladies and gentlemen, we've had
some fun with our little celebrity.

165
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,258
But now, let's meet our big celebrity.

166
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,760
- Big celebrity?
- Say hello to

167
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:34,514
- Daniel Radcliffe!
- Hi, I'm Daniel Radcliffe. Hello.

168
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:37,142
Oh, my god! It's Daniel Radcliffe!

169
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:41,271
We'll find out what our big celebrity
knows right after this break.

170
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:46,735
And we're out.
Oh, we're cooking now.

171
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,654
Hey, you, you're doing great.

172
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,614
I'm not 100 percent watching

173
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,759
because I'm so engrossed
in the second screen experience,

174
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,702
but according to
the second screen experience,

175
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,579
other people are loving the show.

176
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,786
You didn't tell me
there would be another celebrity.

177
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:01,231
Well, I had no idea that was coming

178
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:05,003
but some guy named dong-slinger-420
loved the surprise.

179
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,005
He said, "two dongs way up."

180
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:10,550
There was no mention of another bigger
celebrity in the document you faxed?

181
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,136
I couldn't read it. My fax machine
cut it into little strips.

182
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:16,181
- That sounds like a shredder.
- Well, I guess I shredded it to you.

183
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,825
Oh, I gotta deal with this.

184
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,018
If I don't interact with this app
every 80 seconds,

185
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,771
it charges my credit card five dollars.
Love you.

186
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,230
Ehh. Love you too.

187
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,232
Could you get the base
a little less pale?

188
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,027
- Hey, Daniel, good to see you.
- Always nice to meet a fan.

189
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:33,156
- No, sorry, I'm not... I'm an actor.
- Oh, good for you.

190
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,658
It's a dreadful business
but hang in there.

191
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,078
No, I already did hang in there.
I'm bojack horseman?

192
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,370
We've actually met before.

193
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:42,749
At Chris Martin's holiday party?
We stepped outside for a smoke?

194
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,626
- To get away from Chris Martin?
- Huh.

195
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,711
You opened up
about your fear of success?

196
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:47,921
I gave you some advice?

197
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:51,549
You said I was a true friend
and you would never forget me?

198
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,094
And you said your name
was Chadwick boseman?

199
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,096
- Bojack horseman.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

200
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,307
When you're as famous as I am,
you meet so many people.

201
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,059
Sorry, we need you guys back on set.

202
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:04,020
You were the second hairdresser's
assistant on the Ellen show

203
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,064
about five years ago.
Veronica, right?

204
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,942
- Yeah, that's right.
- How was your mother's party in the end?

205
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:13,029
And we're back in five, four,
three, two...

206
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,739
So you never say one, huh?

207
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:17,867
- Welcome back, america.
- We love you, Daniel.

208
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:21,788
So do I. So let's watch
our celebrities go... audience?

209
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,165
Head to head!

210
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,000
How could they possibly know that?

211
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,211
This is the first episode, right?

212
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:32,090
The puppets clap
when the puppetmaster pulls the strings.

213
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:35,385
Hello. Serious,
going-places Todd at your service.

214
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:38,680
Hey, look at you, all dressed up
for the dipshit awards.

215
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,890
You know you're not allowed
in hair and makeup.

216
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,810
- Are you wearing roller skates?
- I'm wearing heelys.

217
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,771
They're shoes with wheels,
for efficiency purposes.

218
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:50,775
- Now I can be serious faster.
- You can also go nowhere faster.

219
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:53,236
Seeing as I am a professional...

220
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,198
Oh, bojack.

221
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,409
Another embarrassingly
wrong answer,

222
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,746
bringing your score down
by 80 points and 12 dollars.

223
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,874
Why are we playing
for both points and dollars?

224
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,626
- Oh, tough break, b.J. Novak!
- My name is...

225
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,336
Our next question is to Mr. Radcliffe.

226
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:14,757
"What color comes from
the combination of blue and yellow?"

227
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,009
I actually know this one.

228
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,428
When I was growing up,
my neighbor was a painter.

229
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,930
I remember visiting his flat
and watching him work.

230
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,058
Sometimes he would mix together
blue paint with yellow paint

231
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,977
and it made an entirely new color.

232
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,855
And that man was banksy.
And that color was green.

233
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,024
- Final answer.
- Correct!

234
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,067
You've earned
the chance to go for a spin

235
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,403
in our kia sportage cash grab booth.

236
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,199
Oh, splendid.

237
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,702
And while Daniel's in the booth,
bojack, you have an essay question.

238
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,913
- What?
- You'll find a blue book on your podium.

239
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,916
"To what extent was feudalism
a cause of the French revolution?"

240
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,667
- Wait, are you ser... oh!
- And go!

241
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,794
While bojack works,
let's check out the action

242
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,464
on our kia sportage cash grab booth cam.

243
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,675
- Hey, champ.
- What are you doing here?

244
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,002
I'm trying to write an essay.

245
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,678
I came to ask you how you were doing

246
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,889
and then to tell you
you're not doing so well.

247
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,682
Why am I getting
the hard questions,

248
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,851
while boy wizard over there
just has to know colors

249
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,895
and literally grab cash out of thin air?

250
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,898
A five! This is so easy!

251
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:15,360
I think I might be able to help you out.
Let me tell you a story.

252
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,362
The year was 2003

253
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:20,823
and for some reason, everyone was
playing poker all of a sudden.

254
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:25,286
A then-relevant wilmer valderrama
used to host a weekly how-do-you-do

255
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,706
and all the stars
came out to show off their tricks.

256
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:33,044
There was Lucy lawless, Lucy liu,
Lori laughlin, Lisa loeb,

257
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:35,964
the dog from frasier,
and at the head of the table?

258
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,759
Big money himself, Mr. Peanutbutter.

259
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,135
Whoops. Woh-oh.

260
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,221
I thought, "here's a rube."

261
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:48,142
But lady luck had other plans.

262
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,829
You know what,
I got an essay to write,

263
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,790
so if this isn't about the precipitous
fall of the French ruling class...

264
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:55,775
But then I saw, the kid had a tell.

265
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,114
I feel like that story had a lot
of unnecessary details in it.

266
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,575
Listen. You have to pay close attention,
it's subtle,

267
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:10,081
but when he gets excited, his ears ever
so slightly flop up and give him away.

268
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:13,459
Well, that's no surprise. Guy's been
flopping upwards his whole career.

269
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,421
Mm-hm. Watch the ears.

270
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,300
Time's up, Daniel.

271
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,970
Whoa, looks like d to the r
to the ad to the cliffe

272
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,973
just won 54,000 bonus dollars.

273
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,935
And bojack barely got beyond
his thesis statement.

274
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,439
"A continent ravaged by war,

275
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:37,275
coupled with the retreat
of the church from secular life..."

276
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,319
And then it just stops?

277
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,238
Oh, that's gonna cost
you some serious pesos.

278
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:45,325
But first, it's time for
our multiple choice buzz-in round.

279
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,076
A buzz-in round? All right.

280
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,495
In is my favorite direction
in which to buzz.

281
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,081
Tell me, "how many oak trees are needed

282
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:56,586
to build an 18th century triple-Decker
royal Navy battle ship?

283
00:13:56,878 --> 00:14:00,131
A, 75? B, 1000?

284
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,258
Or c, 3500?"

285
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,385
C! 3500!

286
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:06,554
- Um, correct.
- Uh, what?

287
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,528
Uh, wow. That's, uh...

288
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,224
That's actually correct.

289
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:13,853
How the hell did he know that? What else
does he know? Does he know things?

290
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,020
Let's find out.

291
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:19,984
Quantum tunneling.
King Magnus the second.

292
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,403
Miss Scarlet in the library
with the lead pipe.

293
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,406
Sassafras. Butterscotch! Argyle.

294
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,284
Because seven eight nine.

295
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:31,996
What an amazing run.
It looks like we've got a tied game.

296
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,999
Which is an exciting surprise.

297
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,960
- Goddamn it, throw to commercial.
- We'll be right back.

298
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:44,592
- Hey. Horshack. What's going on?
- What's going on is I'm kicking your ass.

299
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,845
Yeah, you know, you're doing great,
but I'm supposed to win.

300
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,348
That was the deal.
Plug my movie, win money for charity.

301
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:52,433
Well, tell charity she can kiss my ass.

302
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,370
By the way,
your girlfriend has a stripper name.

303
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:57,522
It's not my girlfriend, it's charity.

304
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,569
Bojack, according to this app,
you're almost tied.

305
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,531
Oh, you are tied, there's a lag.
Congratulations.

306
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,324
Thanks. It was touch and go...

307
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,909
But I'm a little concerned

308
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,412
because it seems like
you might actually win,

309
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,123
but everyone on the app
is really rooting for Daniel.

310
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,290
People love him.

311
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:20,420
I guess he was in some movie about a
Potter or a pottery barn or something?

312
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,673
- Are you asking me to throw the game?
- You don't care about this game.

313
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:27,260
The only reason you're here is for me,
so maybe you could help me out?

314
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,303
- Okay.
- You know what?

315
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,515
You're the best, no matter
what everybody on this app says.

316
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:37,979
They say you're the worst. Especially
queefburglar69. He's their leader.

317
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:44,444
And we're back. Contestants, I've got
a history question for both of you.

318
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:50,324
"You may or may not be familiar with a
famous racehorse named secretariat.

319
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,369
In what year did secretariat
win the triple crown?"

320
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:54,579
Bojack.

321
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,289
Piece of cake.

322
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,082
Hmm?

323
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,919
Um, 1492?

324
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,464
What? No, not even close.

325
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,467
Bojack, aren't you in a movie
about secretariat?

326
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:11,137
- How could you not know that?
- Let's just move on.

327
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,181
Maybe instead,
he should be in a movie

328
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:16,601
about a guy who doesn't know
anything about secretariat.

329
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,269
That would not be a good movie.

330
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:21,564
I mean, more like secre-terrible.

331
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,484
Damn, bojangles, you got served.

332
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,321
Do you know anything about secretariat?
You know he was a horse, right?

333
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,615
Oh, wait, did I just spoil it for you?

334
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,659
No wonder my wife
had to write your book for you.

335
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:37,997
Hey, yeah, you know, while we're talking
about your wife, I've got a question.

336
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:41,125
How come your wife flew
all the way to war-torn cordovia

337
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:42,543
just to get away from you?

338
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,047
That's not what happened.
She went to help people.

339
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:49,509
Or maybe she went to help herself
get away from her awful marriage.

340
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:54,514
- Oh, was that too far?
- Oh-ho, you want to get into things?

341
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,058
- Well, I mean...
- No, no, no, let's get into things.

342
00:16:57,225 --> 00:17:01,062
Let's get real.
Everybody, bojack wants to get real.

343
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:05,149
Cancel the bubble round.
Because we're getting real.

344
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,110
Should we cut to commercial?

345
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,279
Would homer cut away
from odysseus's journey

346
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:13,282
just as he was being enticed
by the sirens' song?

347
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,369
Well, there you are.

348
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,455
Things are getting real out here.
Really real.

349
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:22,333
Really really really real!

350
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,629
- Uh, I'm not sure where you're going...
- Oh, no?

351
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,631
You knew
where you were going with my wife

352
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,092
the time you pulled over
by the side of the road.

353
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,386
- You know, a week before we got married?
- Uh...

354
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,513
You want to talk about that, bojack?

355
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:40,518
You want to talk about the time when you,
my "good friend," kissed my wife?

356
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,019
- No!
- Yes.

357
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,546
Did something
exciting just happen?

358
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:47,233
Because people on the app are,
and I quote, “losing their tits."

359
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,403
Oh, no, no, I've stumbled on to
a cancer support message board.

360
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,696
Okay, how do I...?

361
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,155
How did you know about that?

362
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:56,033
Well, there are roadside cameras
all along the pch,

363
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,077
I have a few friends
in the highway patrol,

364
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,246
and she told me of course,
we're married!

365
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,457
Wait, so you've known all this time?

366
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,460
Now this is television. Turn on the rain.

367
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,088
Um, don't you think
you're pushing them too far?

368
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:12,425
I'll tell you when it's too far.
This is my art, goddamn it.

369
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:17,471
I'm j. Goddamn d.
Goddamn salinger, and I want rain!

370
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,810
All I ever wanted was to be your friend.

371
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,355
And you treat me like a big joke.

372
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,691
You think I don't notice?
Why don't you like me?

373
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,901
- Mr. Peanutbutter...
- No, tell me.

374
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:34,155
- Because I'm jealous.
- Oh.

375
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:37,408
- Of what? Diane?
- No.

376
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:40,661
Of everything.
Everything comes so easy for you.

377
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,288
Oh, and it doesn't for you?

378
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:45,499
You're a millionaire movie star
with a girlfriend who loves you,

379
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:49,337
acting in your dream movie.
What more do you want?

380
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,590
What else could
the universe possibly owe you?

381
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:56,510
I want to feel good about myself.

382
00:18:56,677 --> 00:19:00,222
The way you do.
And I don't know how.

383
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,724
I don't know if I can.

384
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:05,102
Whoa, guys, this is getting
a little heavy, don't we think?

385
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,396
I'm sorry, Mr. Peanutbutter.

386
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,649
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

387
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:14,654
Wow, um, I don't know
if I can forgive you.

388
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,240
But I guess we'll find out
right after this break.

389
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:22,370
- Damn.
- Shut up.

390
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:28,292
I knew it. I knew this show would
bring us to the heights of human drama

391
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,670
more powerfully than literature
ever dreamed.

392
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,881
Now somebody go out and get me
a red bull and a banana fish sandwich.

393
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,426
On it. It's a perfect day for a red bull.

394
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,719
Whoo-oh!

395
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,389
- Mr. Peanutbutter!
- Oh, hey Wanda.

396
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,558
I'm only half paying attention to
whatever you two are arguing about

397
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,478
but it's killer.
Now all we need is a happy ending.

398
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:50,648
I don't think we can just resolve
everything cleanly in a half-hour.

399
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,525
Uh, this is network television.

400
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:56,779
So resolving everything cleanly in
a half-hour is kind of what we do.

401
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:59,824
You want to host a game show where
everyone feels bad at the end?

402
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,577
You can get in your little car, drive to
Santa Monica and pitch it to amc.

403
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,414
But these people want resolution, okay?

404
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,584
So you get your little butt back
on that stage and you resolve.

405
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:13,295
Uh...

406
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,922
And we're back.

407
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,467
You know, I did some thinking
over the break. Bojack...

408
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:21,793
- What's going on?
- Oh, my god.

409
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,472
No! No! What's happening?

410
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:24,974
Oh.

411
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:33,315
Someone unplugged the main power line
and plugged in a George foreman grill.

412
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,485
Panini time. Hey, who unplugged...

413
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,280
Todd! Goddamnit, step aside!

414
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:42,408
Mia, good work.
You saved the show.

415
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:45,745
You earned my respect and this pen.

416
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,622
Oh, thank you.

417
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:50,833
Aww.

418
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,754
Oh, are we back? We're back!
Live television, folks.

419
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,798
You know, during the break,
my producers told me

420
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,718
I had to forgive bojack
live on the air.

421
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,888
But I'm my own dog.

422
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,640
And as my own dog, I decided

423
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:10,561
to forgive bojack live on the air!
Bring it in, buddy!

424
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:11,729
- What?
- Really?

425
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:14,398
Mr. Peanutbutter,
I applaud your forgiving nature,

426
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,901
but this guy kissed your wife.

427
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,069
Wait, bojack kissed Diane?

428
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,491
The only way to even the score is
if you get to kiss him.

429
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,035
- Wait, what?
- You're right, it makes perfect sense.

430
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,828
- Yeah, absolutely.
- No, it doesn't.

431
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,498
That way Diane and I will have
had the same experience.

432
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,750
It's the only way we can move past this.

433
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,878
Well, if it helps us move past this,
I guess...

434
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:40,591
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

435
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:42,927
Cue the kiss cam.

436
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:52,561
Oh, if only I'd had a kiss cam
for catcher in the rye.

437
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,981
Well, just one more regret
on a long list of many.

438
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,861
Todd, there you are. You're missing
a pretty big moment out there.

439
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:06,367
I don't care. You said it yourself.
Without that pen, I'm totally worthless.

440
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:09,829
Not for nothing, but you were worthless
before you didn't get the pen.

441
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:16,293
I really tried this time. I guess
I'll never really amount to anything.

442
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:20,297
Well, maybe you just need
someone to believe in you.

443
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:23,843
Wow, no one's ever
fallen for that!

444
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,512
- What?
- You're so stupid!

445
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:30,099
You had the pen
and you just gave it to me?

446
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,601
Oh, I can't believe that worked.

447
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:35,980
Oh, my god, look at your stupid face.

448
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,815
The pen is just a symbol.
It doesn't...

449
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:41,443
Yeah, said the girl
who doesn't have a pen right now.

450
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,573
Unbelievable. You are the most annoying,
immature, aggravating,

451
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,533
irritating, crazy-making...

452
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,953
Oh, she was mad, all right. But kids?

453
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,874
That's the story of
how I met this pen.

454
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,919
Hey, get out of hair and makeup
and give me back my pen!

455
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:02,339
I got your pen.
That means you respect me.

456
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,884
- No it does not.
- Viva toddfoolery!

457
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,719
Suck a dick, dumbshits.

458
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,679
Hey! Hey, hey!

459
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:14,727
Well, that stern but supple kiss
puts you over the top.

460
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,438
Bojack horseman is tonight's winner.

461
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,400
Well played, jock-jam door-slam.

462
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:24,570
You've earned $500,000 for charity.

463
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:29,533
You can walk away right now
or, and remember, this is for charity,

464
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,578
you can risk it all in
our double or nothing round.

465
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:36,707
I wanna risk it all!

466
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:39,960
All right. Now that's $500,000.

467
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,463
If you get this question right,
you double that,

468
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,381
a million dollars for charity.

469
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,634
But if you get it wrong,
the charity gets nothing

470
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:51,472
and all the money will be set on fire
live here on our studio sound stage.

471
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:54,016
Bojack, for all the marbles:

472
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,894
"Which famous actor
played the titular role

473
00:23:57,061 --> 00:24:00,731
in the popular Harry Potter
film franchise?"

474
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,107
- Oh.
- Huh.

475
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,486
Yeah. I don't know.

476
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:08,197
When you're as famous as I am,
you meet so many people,

477
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,532
it's impossible to remember them all.

478
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,910
Okay, I get what you're doing. Very funny.

479
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:16,121
Yeah. Oh, what is that guy's name?

480
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,707
You know, it's on the tip of my tongue?

481
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,085
Are you serious right now?
Dude, this is for charity.

482
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,879
- Bojack, we need an answer.
- Yeah, I don't know.

483
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:25,798
Gosh, I wanna say...

484
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,761
- Elijah wood?
- What?

485
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,514
Elijah wood?

486
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,935
J“ back in the '903 j”

487
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:43,107
j“ I was in a very famous TV show j“

488
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,695
j“ I'm bojack the horse
bojack! J“

489
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:52,157
j“ bojack the horse
don't act like you don't know j“

490
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:58,789
j“ and I'm trying to hold onto my past j“

491
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:03,711
j“ it's been so long
