1
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,345
When you two first came into my office,

2
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:15,224
I was like,
"This marriage is not going to last."

3
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:20,938
But you've really put the work in.
I deem your marriage fixed.

4
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,231
Thanks, Dr. Janet.

5
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:25,817
We couldn't have done this without you
and your many novelty certificates.

6
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:30,030
Well, this has certainly been a big year
for the Rabitowitz marriage.

7
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,281
It certainly has.

8
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:34,660
But now it's New Year's Eve and, Katie,
my New Year's resolution to you

9
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:37,621
is to spend more time
with my wonderful wife, who I--

10
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,790
I gotta take this.

11
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,458
-Oh, um, but--
-Hello.

12
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,085
Hey, partner, big news. Huge news.

13
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,253
I'm all ears.

14
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:46,505
<i>The Flight of the Pegasus</i>
just lost their lead.

15
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:47,923
They start shooting next week.

16
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:52,844
So what you're telling me is David Pincher
needs a new star immediately

17
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:56,598
for his three-picture young adult
dystopian future franchise?

18
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:58,100
Yup. What's that I hear?

19
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,060
Beep beep.
Someone's calling on the other line.

20
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,395
That's strange. Hello?

21
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:04,481
It's Oodles of Money calling.
Will we accept the charges?

22
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,483
Why would Oodles of Money
be calling collect?

23
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:09,069
I don't know. Don't accept the charges,
we cannot afford it.

24
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,405
I gotta go in. I'm sorry.

25
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:14,741
Okay. But make sure
you're back before, you know.

26
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:17,619
Deal. Best deal I ever made.

27
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:20,998
Boom!
What's black and white and sexy all over?

28
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,165
Chuff Hollister.

29
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:25,002
He's young, he's hot,
he's Australian or British or whatever.

30
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,671
We can paint over his stripes
so he looks like a horse.

31
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,966
I can see the headline now:
Chuff Hollister is...

32
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,467
The next Pegasus.

33
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:35,887
BoJack's got star power and grit
up the wazoo. I can't imagine...

34
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:39,433
Anyone who would appeal
to the audience more than Chuff.

35
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,642
He's got sex appeal...

36
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,144
- Gravitas...
- Youth...

37
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,272
- Experience...
- And abs coming out of the wazoo.

38
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,024
And what a wazoo it is.

39
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,693
- This would put Gekko-Rabitowitz--
- On the map.

40
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,446
The map of profitable agencies, that is.

41
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,573
Perfect, because without it
we could be in--

42
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,659
Real trouble. We did not hit
our projected earnings for the year.

43
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:00,912
The year's not over yet.
We still have one day to go all out.

44
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:03,540
Rutabaga, do you think
we have the spunk and moxie--

45
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,709
That's a good name
for a lady detective series.

46
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,253
--required to pull this off
and save the agency?

47
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:09,630
Hell yeah, I do.

48
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:12,758
That would be a great title
for a movie about marrying Satan.

49
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,801
How are we losing money?

50
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:17,596
Vanessa, we're getting Chuff this part
and coming out on top.

51
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:21,266
I know we will,
because we're the good guys.

52
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:30,150
<i>♪♪</i>

53
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:21,159
Suck a duck a duck a dick, dumbshit.

54
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:22,911
- Hey, Sarah Lynn.
<i>- Hey, loser.</i>

55
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,414
Did you get a call
about that <i>Ethan Around</i> thing?

56
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:27,999
- You're not gonna do it, are you?
- I'm sorry, what thing?

57
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:32,045
<i>Ethan Around,</i> the <i>Horsin' Around</i>
sequel series Brad's trying to get made?

58
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:35,757
He called to ask me, I asked him,
can you put a bullet in my brain?

59
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:38,009
That would probably be
a better career move.

60
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,512
Wait, slow down.
Did you say <i>Ethan Around?</i>

61
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,056
I know.
It should be <i>Sabrina Around,</i> right?

62
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,850
That's a show people would watch.

63
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:48,103
Sabrina doing cool skateboard tricks
and eating kettle corn.

64
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:51,815
Hold on, if this was a real thing,
why would Brad call you and not me?

65
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,650
Who knows?
Why do people do anything?

66
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:57,571
Why did I make the cartoon tree grandma
from <i>Pocahontas</i> my emergency contact?

67
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,407
Are you sure this whole thing
isn't just a semi-lucid fever dream

68
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,908
from mixing the wrong pills?

69
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,870
Did you not hear?
I'm clean and sober, eight months.

70
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:05,996
Really? That's incredible.

71
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,498
Yeah, I wanted a change in my life.

72
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,126
Because I heard
if you stop doing drugs for a while,

73
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,045
the first time you do them again,
it's amazing.

74
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,631
-What? No, just stay sober.
-Ugh!

75
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:19,426
Whatever.
Call me when you're ready to party.

76
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,682
Well, that's troubling.

77
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,310
Can you believe they're doing
a <i>Horsin' Around</i> reboot without me?

78
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,480
What do you care?
You're about to be nominated for an Oscar.

79
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,273
Not the point. This is about respect.

80
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,400
BoJack, is this really a good idea?

81
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,069
Tools. Brad speaking.

82
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,530
You're doing a new show
in the extended <i>Horsin' Around</i>

83
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,365
cinematic universe and you didn't call me?

84
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:46,077
Hey, BoJack.
<i>Ethan Around</i> is just an idea I had.

85
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,913
<i>It's not officially happening or anything.</i>

86
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:52,167
I would love for you to be part of it,
but the horse died in the series finale.

87
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,462
So? We could write around that.
The Horse dying was just a dream.

88
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,340
The Horse had a twin brother,
comes back as a ghost.

89
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:01,218
Ethan missed the Horse so much
he built a robot Horse as a tribute.

90
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:05,347
"I've heard of overloaded motherboards,
but this is ridiculous."

91
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,016
Those are off the top of my head,
they're all gold.

92
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,768
I'm surprised you're so into the idea.

93
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,479
I've been having trouble
getting networks on the phone,

94
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,899
but with a big star like you attached,
we could sell this right away.

95
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,400
I wouldn't say I'm attached...

96
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:20,445
Don't move.
I'm getting the next flight down to LA.

97
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,322
- Right now?
- And purchased.

98
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,157
BoJack, for the last 20 years

99
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,910
I've been telling people
I didn't need the trappings of fame,

100
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:30,205
that I was better off,
happy with my little B-plus life

101
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:34,292
at my little B-plus hardware store
in little B-plus Olympia, Washington.

102
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:36,294
B-minus children. But it's a lie.

103
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,922
I miss the warmth of the spotlight
on my face.

104
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,716
The thrill of telling a joke
and feeling it land.

105
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,802
Is that a thrill you experienced?

106
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:48,306
The sitcom stage is my home,
and I'm tired of denying myself that.

107
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,141
I'm ready to come home.

108
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,477
Great.

109
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,813
-Why did you let me call him?
-Ugh.

110
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:01,903
Ah, smell that Labrador Peninsula air.
Keep an eye out for my brother.

111
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:05,365
- How will I know which one's him?
- He's the one that looks like me.

112
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,867
- Got it.
<i>- Who's that dog? Mister P--</i>

113
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,911
- Hello?
- Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

114
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:11,788
Is this an okay time to talk business?

115
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,999
Yeah, I'm just waiting
for Captain Peanutbutter.

116
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,834
What is that, like, a cereal?

117
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,043
No, my brother.

118
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,713
- He's picking us up at the airport.
- Nice.

119
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,132
Speaking of driving people places,

120
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,010
Cabracadabra
had a killer holiday season

121
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,887
and I think New Year's
is going to be even bigger.

122
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:31,891
I'm loving that segue, Todd.
You are a conversational Magellan.

123
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:35,770
Turns out there's a huge demand
for a safe space for women. Who knew?

124
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,522
Honestly, never would've crossed my mind.

125
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:40,317
So I was thinking, what's the next step?

126
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,028
What if we made our safe space
for women...

127
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,365
...also available to men?

128
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,117
That's an untapped market.

129
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,744
All right, then it's agreed.

130
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:51,953
No goodbye?

131
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:54,331
He's a conversational Amelia Earhart.

132
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:58,960
Mr. Peanutbutter and
Captain Peanutbutter in the same room?

133
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,630
What is this, a flashback episode?

134
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:04,299
Captain Peanutbutter, you old so-and-so.

135
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,426
- Get over here.
- Careful.

136
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,472
Where's Mrs. Captain Peanutbutter?

137
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:14,017
She's in Alaska running the Iditarod.
She sends her love.

138
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,852
And this noogie.

139
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,021
Whoo!

140
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,398
Diane, this is my big brother.

141
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,609
Big brother? I'm five minutes older.

142
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:23,985
And you always will be.

143
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,820
It's nice to meet you, Captain.

144
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:29,032
Hey, put that thing away.
You're family.

145
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,784
Oh!

146
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:37,499
So David Pincher is about to shoot
the <i>Flight of the Pegasus</i> trilogy

147
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,919
in New Zealand,
and BoJack is perfect for the lead.

148
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,088
A part like that would really underline

149
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:47,342
that BoJack's more than just an actor,
he's a movie star.

150
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,552
If I'm doing that,
I conveniently won't be able

151
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,388
to do that dumbass
<i>Ethan Around</i> show.

152
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,139
Use that when you tell him I won't do it.

153
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,891
Why don't you tell him
you don't want to do it?

154
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,102
I can't. I'm like a father figure to him--

155
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,603
I slept with his mother.

156
00:07:58,687 --> 00:07:59,604
- Gross.
- No.

157
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:02,524
I slept with her 20 years ago.
She was young then, not gross.

158
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,441
Ugh!

159
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:06,569
Hey, loved you in
<i>The Caveman's Valentine.</i>

160
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,530
- Hmm?
- Nothing? <i>The Caveman's Valentine?</i>

161
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,408
Samuel L. Jackson had that big beard?
Look it up.

162
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,243
- When you start laughing, call me.
- Will do.

163
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,245
Do we have an offer
on the <i>Pegasus</i> movie?

164
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,455
I'll get it, Kalamata.
Don't get your pita in a wad.

165
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,833
Wow. <i>Flight of the Pegasus.</i>

166
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,918
This must be
what Robert Downey Jr. felt like

167
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,795
when he woke up on that
stranger's bathroom floor

168
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,588
and found out he was gonna be Iron Man.

169
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:31,928
<i>It's another unseasonably</i>
<i>warm day in the Labrador Peninsula</i>

170
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,389
<i>and things are looking sunny</i>
<i>all the way to the new year.</i>

171
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,974
<i>It really is true what they say...</i>

172
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,893
Nothing bad ever happens
on the Labrador Peninsula.

173
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,478
Oh, paradise.

174
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,246
Uncle Mister. Uncle Mister.

175
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,666
Now who let these little monsters
onto my peninsula?

176
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,917
We're your nephews.

177
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:07,130
What? I don't remember my nephews
being made out of candy.

178
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,507
Gobble, gobble, gobble.

179
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:14,012
Look at those children.
Little miracles, right?

180
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:18,099
They're adorable, not that
I value them based on their looks.

181
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,309
Because, of course,

182
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,228
children in society today
are often reduced to their cuteness.

183
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,315
I can't wait to get
to know your children as people,

184
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,817
so I can specifically
compliment them individually

185
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,028
on the foundation of their characters.

186
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,406
Well, one day they'll die, just like us.

187
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,324
Uh...

188
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,242
- Do you believe in the soul?
- What?

189
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:41,372
Life is the most precious resource
we have. Remember that, Diane.

190
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:42,749
Okay.

191
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,628
Pretty great, right?

192
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:50,924
Did you tell your brother
about the A-B-O-R-T-I-O-N?

193
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,718
The audition?
No, I could never tell him about that.

194
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:56,054
He thinks I'm offer-only,
it would break his heart.

195
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,263
Wait, what audition?

196
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:00,433
- No, the abortion.
- Oh, no. Should I have?

197
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:03,228
He said some weird stuff to me earlier.

198
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,730
The kind of stuff you'd hear
in a sad Creed song.

199
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,524
Or a happy Elliott Smith song.

200
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:11,903
Oh, he's probably just razzing ya,
but he's a good dog. All bark, no bite.

201
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:15,365
Sorry, that's a Labrador expression.
I guess in human terms it would be:

202
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:19,369
He's all talk, and no shooting you
with an assault rifle.

203
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,246
Is that what you think humans do?

204
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,372
Am I wrong?

205
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,001
Boom! This is David Pincher.

206
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:30,505
And this is everyone who works for him.

207
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,798
Now unfortunately for us,

208
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,759
everyone on this board
must really like their boss's movies,

209
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:38,763
because for the holidays,
they're all <i>Gone Girl.</i>

210
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:41,641
Thank you, except for her. Boom.

211
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:45,061
The assistant to David Pincher's
casting director.

212
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:48,481
Wait a second, I know that face.
Why does she look so familiar?

213
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,942
- Oh, fish.
- Oh, fish.

214
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:54,154
So when I found out
that the best assistant I ever had

215
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,947
was working for David Pincher,

216
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,574
I mean, what are the odds?

217
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,952
Did he hire you because of your cute
little Benjamin Button-nose?

218
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:04,539
I'll put in a good word for BoJack,
but I'm just an assistant.

219
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:08,001
Just an assistant?
Laura, assistants are everything.

220
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,336
You're the first people in,
the last people out.

221
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,089
You know everyone's real name, age,
nose, teeth, and tits.

222
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:17,510
You have power, because in today's economy
the only true power is information.

223
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,470
I want you to use that power.

224
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:22,891
I want you to get your boss
to pick BoJack as his Pegasus.

225
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,934
I always believed in you, Laura.

226
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,353
The question is:
do you believe in yourself?

227
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:30,064
Wow, that's--
I'm sorry, did you just make that up?

228
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:33,067
Because that was--
Is that a speech you had ready to go?

229
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,278
- Will you do this for me?
- Of course.

230
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,364
You went to bat for me when I tried
to get a promotion at Vigor.

231
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:41,826
I pushed so hard for you.
I did everything I could.

232
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,787
I mean, we gals gotta look out
for each other. Right?

233
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:45,997
Right.

234
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:52,754
So you're talking about a merger?

235
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,673
Since my dad croaked
I've been running Vigor myself,

236
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:59,135
and I've been doing a pretty good job,
A-minus/B-plus.

237
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,931
But I could use a few more experienced
hands to help guide the ship,

238
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:07,477
- because being a boss is really hard.
- Yes.

239
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,730
Princess Carolyn can be a proud woman.
I'm glad you came to me first.

240
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,523
I would have gone to her directly,

241
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:15,777
but sometimes she yells at me
and I do not like being yelled at

242
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,863
and that is just something that people
need to understand about me.

243
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:21,157
I'll talk to her, when the time is right.

244
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:29,958
So on the new show Ethan is the dad,
and he's raising three little horses.

245
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,126
You couldn't have told me
this over the phone?

246
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,545
This show is going to change my life.

247
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:37,674
I'm taking the kids out of school
and moving everyone down here.

248
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,218
I just had an offer accepted
on a house in Sherman Oaks.

249
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,012
As long as I don't change my mind
before the new year, boom.

250
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,472
Two million dollars, gone.

251
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,391
- The new year? That's tonight.
- I know.

252
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,476
Did you talk to my agent
by any chance?

253
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,811
- No.
- She didn't call you?

254
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,939
I talked to her, and I don't know
if she wants me to do it.

255
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,315
You know how agents are.

256
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,567
Just remember,
I'm not the bad guy here.

257
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:58,277
I hear you loud and clear.

258
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,405
Don't worry.
We won't take no for an answer.

259
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,491
I think my schedule's gonna be tough--
Might be going to New Zealand.

260
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,034
We'll work around your schedule.

261
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,412
Those bastards got my quote
so damn high.

262
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,831
We'll pay it.
No obstacle is insurmountable.

263
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:13,126
- As long as you want to do it.
- And I do want to do it.

264
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,502
Get me out of this thing.

265
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:17,380
This asshole's giving me everything
I ask for. What a nightmare.

266
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,842
- Tell him you don't want to do the show.
- I can't. It would destroy him.

267
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,011
Destroying people is what I pay you to do,

268
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:25,346
so I don't think about the people
I'm destroying.

269
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,432
Do you not know what an agent is?

270
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,018
BoJack, are you okay in there?

271
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,020
Is it number one or number two?

272
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,818
That cat's running circles around us.
What are we going to do?

273
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,904
Maybe we can distract her?
I'm thinking laser pointer.

274
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:45,116
If we're going to beat her,
we need to think like her.

275
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,870
Instead of convincing the <i>Pegasus</i>
people they don't want BoJack,

276
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,330
what if we convince BoJack
he doesn't want <i>Pegasus?</i>

277
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,916
Fantastic. How do we do that?

278
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,043
Kelsey.

279
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:58,504
Kelsey? That's what I said when
they said you wanted to meet with me.

280
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,256
I figured you never wanted
to see me again.

281
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,716
I never want to see anyone again,

282
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,344
but there's a book I've been trying
to turn into a movie and I need your help.

283
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:09,390
It's a coming-of-age story
about a girl who likes jellybeans.

284
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,100
The option expires tonight at midnight,

285
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,978
unless I can find a big enough star
to secure funding.

286
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,646
Frankly, I already gave up on it.

287
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,191
Then my agent said,
"Maybe BoJack's interested."

288
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,360
So the reason
you think I'm right for the role

289
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,445
is because I'm a big enough star
to secure funding?

290
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,031
Don't get smart, BoJack.
You're not good at it.

291
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,616
You're really giving the hard sell here.

292
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:30,203
I hear they've got you locked in
to some fantasy dystopia thing.

293
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,081
Are you just gonna do stupid bullshit
for the rest of your life?

294
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,749
For work or, like, in general?

295
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,460
I saw something in you,
something most people don't know you have,

296
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,171
and it kills me that instead
of sharing it with the world,

297
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:43,508
you want to hide it under some
wonderland unicorn nonsense.

298
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,010
It's a Pegasus. Unicorns are for babies.

299
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,179
The movie I want to make
isn't glamorous or sexy.

300
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,556
You don't get to be the big hero
everybody loves.

301
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,850
You get to be a guy
who works at a gas station,

302
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:55,269
who gets in a fight with his daughter
about jellybeans.

303
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:58,314
That's the whole movie.
It's small and it's real.

304
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:01,776
And you'd get to work
with a director who sees you.

305
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,779
And I can't sell it any better than that.

306
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,532
You're right, that one scene
we shot that didn't even make it

307
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:10,076
into the <i>Secretariat </i>movie
was the best thing I ever did.

308
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,620
Why am I wasting my time
with this other stuff?

309
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,205
- So you're in?
- Let's do it.

310
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:16,833
Great. How's your little friend
with the face?

311
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,210
Is he up to his old tricks,
getting into scrapes?

312
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:22,130
What a little scamp.
Will you tell him I said hi?

313
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,636
Kelsey's movie sounds perfect.

314
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:32,640
Is it the nobody's-gonna-see-it element
or the fact you'll be working for peanuts?

315
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:36,394
This jellybean thing could show the world
that BoJack's more than just a movie star.

316
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,646
- He's an actor.
- Yeah, well, that's great,

317
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,315
but I've been working all day
on getting him the <i>Pegasus </i>movie

318
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,651
you said would show the world
he's a movie star.

319
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,571
I don't want that anymore.
I want to do something real.

320
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,990
You realize how much money
we'd be walking away from?

321
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,741
This isn't about money.
Doesn't matter to me.

322
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,828
- Yeah, it doesn't matter to you.
- Right. So what's the problem?

323
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,164
Maybe you can find a way
for BoJack to do both?

324
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:59,417
You're supposed to be
this amazing agent, after all.

325
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,252
I'll see what I can do.

326
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,216
New beers for the new year's?

327
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,344
We got a regular
Maya Angelou over here.

328
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,180
Good times.

329
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,307
Oh, it's Todd. Gotta take this.

330
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,934
- Maybe you can call him back later?
- Todd!

331
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:20,146
Don't be too long,
or I'm gonna drink all your beer.

332
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:24,484
Diane, do you ever look up at the stars

333
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:27,445
and feel like
they're tiny holes in the sky,

334
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,531
sucking out all the oxygen,
and suddenly you can't breathe

335
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:34,911
because you're thinking about how small
you are and how meaningless it all is?

336
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,288
Uh... I guess.

337
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,707
It's so cruel to let people love you.

338
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:44,587
All you're doing is promising
you'll one day break their hearts.

339
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,339
Cool fire pit.

340
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:53,721
So it turns out men love safe spaces
for women even more than women do.

341
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:57,183
You gotta read some of these comments.
Queefburglar69 says:

342
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:01,521
"These sexy lady chauffeurs
always get me where I need to go."

343
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,147
That's unambiguous.

344
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,484
The only problem is some of the drivers
have been complaining

345
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,110
about the new customer base.

346
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:12,240
The workers are allowed to complain?
We gotta tighten up that ship.

347
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,825
Most of the new passengers
are perfect gentlemen,

348
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:17,828
but we've found that a growing number
are rating our drivers

349
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:21,165
not on performance but on "bangability",

350
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:25,086
which creates an unfair advantage
for our "bangable" drivers

351
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:29,048
and creates what some
of our more homely employees

352
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:34,011
have dubbed a hostile sexy-ocracy.
Whoa!

353
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:38,099
Well, our first priority is creating
a safe space for women,

354
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,476
so if our women
don't feel safe in that space,

355
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,770
we should replace them
with women who do.

356
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:47,942
Where can we find women who are
comfortable around gentlemen?

357
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,278
I know. A gentleman's club.

358
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:51,404
That's perfect.

359
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,197
To Whale World.

360
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,159
Well, you didn't hear it from me,

361
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,453
but I pulled some strings and you're in.

362
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,247
I always knew you were a superstar.

363
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,790
Let's get drinks in the new year

364
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,209
and work out the deets--
That's a fast way of saying details

365
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:08,462
for people who don't have time
for every detail of the word details.

366
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:09,880
Vanessa Gekko on line two.

367
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,882
Great, put that raggedy-ass bitch on.

368
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,343
I'm gonna bat her around
like a ball of foil.

369
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:18,097
I know you're excited, but we are still
in a very precarious position,

370
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,601
and I wonder if foil-ball-batting
is the best tack here.

371
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,604
Judah, this is where I live.
Watch and learn.

372
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:28,357
Hey, we heard BoJack and Kelsey
had a great meeting on <i>Jelly Belle.</i>

373
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,735
Gotta tie this up tonight
if it's going to happen.

374
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,445
BoJack would love to do the movie,

375
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,281
but you're gonna have to work
around his <i>Pegasus</i> schedule.

376
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,825
Oh, um... That might be tricky.

377
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,952
Then you're gonna have to match
his <i>Pegasus </i>quote.

378
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:43,122
- He won't do it for a penny less.
- Princess Carolyn--

379
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,375
Even with a star like BoJack,
Kelsey can't get that kind of money.

380
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,002
Well, then, work around his schedule.

381
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:51,589
You're overplaying your hand, PC,
and I'm calling your bluff.

382
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:55,134
I'm barreling towards you fast, Gekko,
and this Mack truck ain't gonna blink.

383
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:58,137
That's not fair. I was clearly
establishing a poker metaphor,

384
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,264
you just changed it to a game of chicken.

385
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:01,641
My court. My rules.

386
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:03,684
Court? What game are you playing?

387
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:04,977
Bye.

388
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,854
- Damn it!
- Question:

389
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,940
Am I the faulty bike tire pump
I had in seventh grade?

390
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:12,693
Because I just blew this thing wide open.

391
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:15,237
- Talk to me, soldier.
- I have been scouring old emails.

392
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,240
I didn't know what I was looking for.
I knew there was something.

393
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,576
And I found it. Bam!

394
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:25,206
Hot shit on a ham sandwich,
this is amazing!

395
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,585
Sweet crap on a croissant,
Katie's going into labor!

396
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,838
Go, I'll take care of this.
Family comes first.

397
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:35,091
Thank you. You make me stronger.

398
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:42,223
Why is my house filled with sexy orcas?

399
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:46,769
It's the Cabracadabra New Year's party.
These are our drivers.

400
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,688
Oh. Uh, where's Emily?

401
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:51,774
She left.
She said she didn't feel comfortable here.

402
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:55,152
She certainly didn't feel comfortable
paying for the food she ate.

403
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:58,114
Yeah, okay, BoJack.

404
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,869
I got champagne for my real friends,
'cause that's what you are.

405
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,996
- A real friend.
- He doesn't want to do your show.

406
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,040
- What?
- BoJack is about to win an Oscar.

407
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,584
Why do you think he would want
to do your soon-to-fail sitcom

408
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:13,462
about the further adventures
of a carb-faced nobody?

409
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,923
- Oh, maybe--
- You are not a television star.

410
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:20,136
You have no talent and I am forgetting
your face even as I'm looking at it.

411
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,054
Pack your bags.
Go back to Nowheresville.

412
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:26,517
Thank you for the champagne.
Best regards, Ana Spanakopita.

413
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:32,189
Oh, God, the house!
I gotta pull my deposit! Pick up--

414
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,650
Oh, no. I dropped my phone in a bog.

415
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:40,281
Something is going on with your brother.
You need to talk to him.

416
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,659
We don't really have the kind of
relationship where we talk about things.

417
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,411
Labs prefer to keep things playful.

418
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,998
You know what they say about dogs?
Talking to each other is rrruff.

419
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,750
I'm serious, Mr. Peanutbutter.

420
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,836
And I'm serious that you should drop it.

421
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,422
If something was really wrong,
he would tell me about it.

422
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,339
Would he?

423
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,800
I know he's your brother,
but he's hiding something from you.

424
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:02,178
Why do you think you know my brother
better than I do?

425
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,597
Just because you have a shitty
relationship with your family

426
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,558
doesn't mean every other family
has to have drama too.

427
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,477
I wanted to come up here
and have a nice time.

428
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,103
This place is an escape for me.

429
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:14,064
- Okay, I'm sorry, I just--
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

430
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:16,734
I should not have shouted at you.
I just...

431
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,861
I need to go for a walk.

432
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:27,453
- Oh, hey.
- Hey, is there something going on?

433
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,956
Because I know there isn't,
but if there is, you would tell me, right?

434
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,541
But there's nothing to tell,

435
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,419
because nothing bad ever happens
on the Labrador Peninsula.

436
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:38,297
- Okay, I think you should sit down.
- Why?

437
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,091
- I need to talk to you. Sit down.
- I will not sit down.

438
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:43,344
- Mr. Peanutbutter, sit.
- Okay.

439
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:47,139
- I got a twisted spleen.
- No.

440
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:50,017
It's not fatal, necessarily.
Everything's gonna be fine.

441
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,936
They still have to run some tests.

442
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,313
- But it's going to be fine?
- Yeah.

443
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,732
Promise me it's going to be fine?
You're my big brother.

444
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,859
That means you can't lie to me about this.

445
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:03,197
Mr. Peanutbutter, you are the best
runt of the litter a guy could ask for.

446
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,448
No, don't do this.

447
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:06,909
- But there might come a time...
- Please.

448
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:10,037
...when you're going
to have to be the captain.

449
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:14,458
What is this, a very special episode?

450
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,684
What? What do you mean?
What happened?

451
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,936
It's a no-go on BoJack for <i>Pegasus.</i>

452
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,479
<i>I don't understand, Laura. I...</i>

453
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:38,941
I just wanted you to know.
I did everything I could.

454
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,698
- Hey.
<i>- Look...</i>

455
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,951
If you didn't wanna do my movie,
you should have just told me.

456
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,744
I do want to do your movie.

457
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:53,289
Oh, yeah? Why did your agent
keep demanding more money?

458
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,916
<i>- What?</i>
- The option's expired and I'm screwed.

459
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,462
Ugh! Why did I get my hopes up?
Why do I keep letting you get my hopes up?

460
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:01,714
Kelsey, this is a mistake.

461
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,466
It's a mistake I keep making.
Next time, BoJack?

462
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,052
Do a girl a favor,
don't break her heart by inches.

463
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:09,888
Do it all at once.
It'll save everyone some time.

464
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:11,307
Huh?

465
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,435
Ten, nine, eight...

466
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:17,813
Oh, good, you're still here.

467
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,482
I wanted to get a head start
on the 2016 budget.

468
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,776
It'll be a challenge, but assuming
BoJack books <i>Pegasus--</i>

469
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,612
BoJack didn't book <i>Pegasus.</i>

470
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:27,698
- So he's doing the jellybean movie?
- That fell apart, too.

471
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,491
We're gonna have to cut some costs.

472
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:32,411
Our social media division
is a luxury we can no longer afford.

473
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,831
If things don't perk up the first quarter,
we might be looking at broader layoffs.

474
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:39,418
- Do you ever read a room?
- I'm sorry, is this a bad time?

475
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:42,880
Is midnight on New Year's a bad time?
I don't know.

476
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,424
Why don't you run that through
your robot analysis protocol?

477
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,509
Get back to me
once you've assessed the data.

478
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,970
I am not a robot. I am a human being.

479
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:53,015
You want to make some cuts?
Why don't you cut that stupid beard?

480
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:56,268
Everyone who walks in here thinks
this place is run by a homeless person.

481
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:59,438
I apologize if my appearance
or demeanor is unprofessional.

482
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:04,818
No, you're perfect.
Everybody's perfect except for me.

483
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:05,986
Go home, Judah.

484
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:09,156
- Would you like me to shave the beard?
- Just go home, Judah.

485
