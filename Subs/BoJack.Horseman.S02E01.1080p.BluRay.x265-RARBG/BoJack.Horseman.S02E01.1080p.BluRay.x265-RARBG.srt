I am a good kid and I like to play,

I thought these were salad plates.

The couch was a metaphor

- That depends.

163
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,864
- Are you my ex-wife's lawyer?
- I'm Diane.

164
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,366
I'm here to be a character consultant.

165
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,577
- What?
- I got a call from the studio.

166
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:59,831
Okay. Why don't you stand over there and
make sure no one trips over that cable?

167
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,208
- This cable?
- Do you have a thousand dollars?

168
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,918
- What?
- Because each minute

169
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,921
I spend talking to you,
that's how much money I'm wasting.

170
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,673
- Oh. Sorry.
- Hey, who's this guy?

171
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,160
- Who let this guy in?
- I just...

172
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,218
He's got a funny face. I like your face.

173
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,220
- Thank you.
- What a funny face. Cookie?

174
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,056
Can someone get this guy a cookie?

175
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,558
He's got a soothing face
and I like looking at it.

176
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,393
- Like a Matisse painting.
- Whoa.

177
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,729
Guys, could I get
everyone's attention, please?

178
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,398
Oh, watch out for the cable.
Don't trip over the cable.

179
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,359
I just want everyone to know
what an honor it is to be here.

180
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,654
Secretariat has always been
a personal hero of mine.

181
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,824
A complex role that requires
a precise touch and a deft hand

182
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,702
and I just can't wait to tackle it
head-on.

183
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,287
It's truly an honor.

184
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,164
Namaste.

185
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,711
Neat. So, in this scene,
secretariat's at his lowest.

186
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:50,006
He just lost his first race,
his father was sent to the glue factory.

187
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:51,758
It's a dark moment.

188
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:56,096
- You got it.
- Scene 22 Alpha, take one.

189
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,722
[Inhales, then exhales]

190
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,683
- [Kelsey] Action!
- Hey, secretariat.

191
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:07,899
What are you doing here?

192
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,360
[Chuckles]

193
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:13,238
[Mumbles, then chuckles]

194
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,239
[Kelsey groans]

195
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,698
[Phone buzzing]

196
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,577
- Hello?
- Diane!

197
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,788
I can't tell you how disappointed I am

198
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,916
you're not here with me
in northern cordovia.

199
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,085
I'm incredibly disappointed. Boo!

200
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,754
I didn't think I could do it,
but I did it.

201
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,756
I'm amazing.

202
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:34,092
Sebastian,
I know you're doing important work.

203
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:37,011
I couldn't just drop everything
and fly to the third world.

204
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,222
- I just got married, and...
- [Sebastian] Diane.

205
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,391
People are dying, and I'm witnessing it.

206
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,769
And I need people
to witness me witnessing it.

207
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:48,898
I know, and I'll be there in three months,
as soon as I'm done on the movie.

208
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,150
This is also important.

209
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,610
In a way.

210
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,697
Well, lucky for you,
there'll still be just as much famine

211
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:58,700
and war and devastation
in three months.

212
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,034
I'm not dead yet.

213
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:03,663
- Yep. Lucky me.
- [Man] We're still rolling, people.

214
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,916
So, bojack, in this scene,
secretariat is sad, right?

215
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,835
Afraid he's gonna lose his scholarship.

216
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,671
Oh, sure. Yeah, sad. Of course. Duh.
[Chuckles]

217
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,798
Okay, here we 90. Action.

218
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,049
Hey, secretariat.

219
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,343
What are you doing here?

220
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,639
That was bad. I know that was bad.
Let's keep it rolling.

221
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,641
- I'll say when to keep rolling.
- Okay.

222
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:27,729
What are you doing here? Did we get it?
I can tell by your face that we didn't.

223
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:30,148
All right, let me try again.
What are you doing...?

224
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:34,110
I am having trouble with the words.
Is it okay if I play around with it a bit?

225
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:37,864
When did you get here?
Sorry, no. Got it. Got it. Got it.

226
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,824
Man, these lights are bright, huh?

227
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:42,202
Can we kill these lights at all?
Is that a...?

228
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,953
- No.
- Okay, I'm sad.

229
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,788
I'm sad. Acting sad.

230
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,957
Secretariat is sad.

231
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,125
Okay, here we go.

232
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,919
I'm sad!

233
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,170
Sorry, what was the line?

234
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:56,216
I don't know if this helps or not,
but when secretariat was a kid

235
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,051
- he actually...
- Aah!

236
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,636
- My face!
- [Man 1] Hey, hey.

237
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,262
- Whoa, whoa!
- [Man 2] Oh, my god.

238
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,764
[Man 3] Watch out! [Man 4] Hey.

239
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,807
[Man 5] Oh, no, not me.
[Man 6] Whoa, whoa!

240
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,352
[Pa] Oh, my god. My face.

241
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,103
My beautiful face.

242
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,232
Why didn't someone tell me
not to trip over that cable?

243
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:16,653
It was such an important job,
but no one was there to do it

244
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,572
and now my face is in ruins.

245
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,158
We're gonna need a couple of days
to rebuild the set.

246
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:25,370
So, let's all just use this time
to regroup

247
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:29,165
and really figure out what we're doing

248
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,751
and why we're here.

249
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,003
[Audience laughing]

250
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:40,843
So, let me get this straight.
Bad means good?

251
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,722
Maybe you should leave the teen-talk
to me. Jeezy kableezy.

252
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,766
[Audience laughing]

253
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,105
Well, it wasn't ibsen.

254
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:56,067
That's your takeaway?
That your son's TV show wasn't ibsen?

255
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:58,486
I'm sorry. Did you need a compliment?

256
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:02,156
Oh, I loved the part where you got
your head caught in the banister.

257
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,200
- Yeah...
- And what's this letter I have?

258
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:07,245
It's from the government saying,
"I'm proud of you."

259
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:10,331
- Are you...?
- No, what I'm holding is nothing.

260
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,084
Can you check on our drinks?
I would love some gin.

261
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:16,879
I wouldn't drink anything out of an open
container. This town is full of aids.

262
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,173
- That's not...
- You're a clown, you know that?

263
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,175
You've always been a pillar of support.

264
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,011
Gin, please? 15 there gin coming?

265
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,722
I'm here, aren't I?
I suffered through that ordeal.

266
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,349
You know, the man sitting next to me
was wearing a t-shirt?

267
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,185
A t-shirt, bojack, in the theater.

268
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,353
Yes, a t-shirt.

269
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,148
Worst thing that's happened to anyone
in a theater.

270
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,359
- The t-shirt told me to "just do it."
- Here we go.

271
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,945
I don't know to what "it"
the t-shirt referred

272
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,990
but I won't be spoken to in that tone
by an article of clothing.

273
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,242
Vodka? Triple sec?
Looking for any alcohol.

274
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,369
You don't know how
lucky you are to have me.

275
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:52,290
I hope you die before I do so you never
know what it's like to lose a mother.

276
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,601
Well as long as one of us dies,
that's good enough for me.

277
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:58,588
Can we please get some alcohol
into my mouth?

278
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,507
[Man on recording]
The past is past.

279
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,218
That's why it's called the past.

280
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,554
Tomorrow is an opportunity.

281
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:10,433
You can be big and proud
and bang on your Tom-Tom drum

282
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,020
or you can get in your boat and row.

283
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,189
Tom or row.

284
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,607
Tomorrow.

285
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:20,526
- Hey, do you wanna talk?
- Talk? Why? Why would we do that?

286
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,488
So you can put everything
in a book and sell a million copies?

287
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,989
Wow. Uh...

288
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:28,036
That's what the old me would have said.
The new me doesn't hold a grudge.

289
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:28,701
[Phone rings]

290
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,536
- No.
- I gotta say

291
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,081
the new you seems a little on edge.

292
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,666
What? Me?
I'm as cool as the fonz in a meat locker.

293
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,335
That's a metaphor, Diane.

294
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:38,920
- It's a simile.
- Goddamn it.

295
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:39,712
[Phone rings]

296
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,547
Oh, okay. Hello?

297
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,300
Small talk, small talk, small talk.
Are you blowing it?

298
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:47,970
- I heard you're blowing it.
- What? Who told you that? Was it Todd?

299
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,556
You gotta turn this ship around, boj.
If you don't...

300
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,393
Hey, can you hold on a second?
I'm getting another call.

301
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:58,731
Well, if it isn't my friend rutabaga,
the boy prince of the 26th floor.

302
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:02,568
Carolyn.
How are things all the way up on 27?

303
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,696
Stomp once for good, twice for killing it.

304
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,699
Killing...

305
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,159
Give me some gossip.

306
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,620
My wife is making me go
to the opera tonight.

307
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:15,456
I need something to distract me
from the thought of d-bags

308
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,959
singing songs in German
about their boners.

309
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,128
Okay, you gotta
keep this close to the vest

310
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:23,214
but I am inches
from getting Emily vancamp

311
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:27,218
the lead in goose Van sant's
new movie about Jackie o.

312
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:32,348
My clients would flip
if I got them parts like that.

313
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:35,017
You're killing it
in the department of kicking ass

314
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:38,396
in regards to you being an agent
and being good at it, crushing it.

315
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:41,607
You're not so bad yourself, rutabaga,
for a 26er. [Chuckles]

316
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:45,194
You're the only one in this building
who isn't a total snooze-cooze.

317
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:49,323
Yes, Natasha, I'm talking about you.
I know you're listening.

318
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,160
Ugh. I gotta go. I made Natasha cry.

319
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,120
[Chuckles]

320
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,205
I don't think she's coming back.

321
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,417
Could we keep it down
in the front, please?

322
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,377
- Thank you.
- What am I gonna do?

323
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:05,590
Well, you were an actor for nine years
on horsin' around. How did you do that?

324
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,052
- Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?
- Of course, buddy.

325
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,055
I always have time for you,
my good friend bojack

326
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,891
in this, the year 1988.

327
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:15,683
Have a seat.

328
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:16,933
[Stomping overhead]

329
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,480
Hey, enough with the stomping already!

330
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,692
- Am I...? Am I a clown?
- Oh, brother.

331
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,403
Didn't I tell you not to invite your mom
to the taping?

332
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:32,033
As Max headroom would say,
"your mom is a bitch." [Chuckles]

333
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,076
But I am a good actor, right?

334
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:38,122
Bj, I don't know.
You know what you're good at?

335
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:42,084
Hitting your Mark and saying your lines,
loudly with good diction.

336
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,504
Should I be doing more?
To capture the character

337
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,924
- and make the audience connect?
- This is a situation comedy.

338
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:52,178
No one watches this show to feel feelings.
Life is depressing enough already.

339
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,388
You bring joy to millions of people.

340
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:58,518
Maybe someday later,
you'll need to learn how to act for real.

341
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:02,355
But for now,
[Chuckles] Don't worry about it.

342
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,733
Oh, shit. I'm not an actor.

343
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:09,403
All this time, I assumed there was more
to me than everyone thought

344
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,447
but maybe there isn't.

345
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,283
The part where you're supposed
to disagree with me.

346
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,952
Oh, right.

347
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:19,956
Well, you got the part, didn't you?
What did you do in the audition?

348
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,041
Well, how should I know?
That was the old me.

349
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:25,086
Now I've got a brand-new attitude.

350
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:28,130
Oh, god. Okay. Okay.
What should I do?

351
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,091
Make a break for it? Drive to Mexico?

352
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:33,010
Start a new life there?
Meet a local girl? Fall in love?

353
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,221
Talk my way into a job at a textile plant?

354
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,139
Work my way up until I own the place?

355
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,559
What am I talking about?
I can't run a textile plant.

356
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:43,104
Too much responsibility. What am I
gonna do? The walls are closing in!

357
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:45,982
Bojack, breathe. You can do this.

358
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:49,193
You have two days.
Maybe you could hire an acting coach.

359
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,403
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

360
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,989
Plus, you can watch old
secretariat videos.

361
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,491
I've got a hard drive full of research.

362
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:58,452
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
You're right. I can do this.

363
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,037
I've got two whole days.

364
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,707
And when the pressure's on,
that's when I shine.

365
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:06,627
Yeah. Two days.
I can do all those things.

366
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,965
Oh, shit. I didn't do any of those things.

367
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:15,886
- What are you doing here?
- Ah!

368
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,722
That was it. Say that again.

369
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,182
What are you doing here?

370
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,019
Bojack, before we get started

371
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,937
- I wanted to show you this.
- What?

372
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,523
This is the machine
that's gonna make you a good actor.

373
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,443
- Really?
- We need to make a scan of your face

374
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,154
so that if you die,
we can finish the movie.

375
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:36,699
Standard procedure. When a star
is assessed to be of a certain liability,

376
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:40,953
like if there was a whole book written
about what a reckless jackass he is,

377
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,291
you make a digital replica so you're
not screwed if he goes all belushi on you.

378
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,918
- Wait, which belushi?
- Hold still, please.

379
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,920
[Whirring]

380
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:53,257
- Terrific. We got it.
- One day, that's gonna be the job.

381
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:56,010
Sit for five seconds
while a machine scans his face.

382
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:58,220
Six months later,
plugging a movie on kimmel.

383
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,349
I gotta go on kimmel now?
What if he makes me read a mean tweet?

384
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,975
I'm not emotionally prepared.

385
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,227
Don't worry so much.
If you can't do this part

386
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:09,398
we'll just fire you and get someone else
who can. Either way, I'll be fine.

387
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,443
- [Groans]
- What do you need, bojack?

388
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:16,447
I don't know. I thought I wanted this,
but now I'm feeling all this pressure.

389
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:20,034
- Think you made a mistake, hiring me?
- I don't make mistakes, bojack.

390
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:23,454
I do the crossword in sharpie,
I never learned the shortcut for undo.

391
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,623
- Command-z.
- Don't need it, won't use it.

392
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:29,919
I'm trying to have this new attitude,
be this better, more positive guy.

393
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:33,214
I keep thinking about how this movie
is my last shot at happiness.

394
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,174
Well, bojack, I hope this helps:

395
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,678
I don't care if you are happy or not.

396
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,054
You have a job to do.

397
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:41,514
[Kelsey chuckles]

398
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:45,935
This guy again? I'm in love with this kid.
I wanna put you in my pocket. [Grunts]

399
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,479
- You're adorable.
- Aw.

400
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,564
[Man sobbing]

401
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,109
- Hey, Diane, you're a writer, aren't you?
- Yes.

402
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,195
Yes. I am a writer. What do you need?

403
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,447
Can you write on a sign
"watch out for cable"?

404
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,367
You were telling people,
but it's a really important job

405
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,452
and a sign is less likely
to get distracted.

406
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,622
Oh. Yeah. Okay.

407
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:08,374
What are you doing here?

408
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:09,959
What are you doing here?

409
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:12,044
What are you doing here?

410
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,922
- What are you doing here?
- So, I went a little overboard

411
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:16,674
and I made you two mixes.

412
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,509
The first cd is all mighty mighty.

413
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:22,221
The second cd is all of the bosstones'
side projects and solo singles.

414
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:25,224
Listen to it and imagine the band
never took that hiatus

415
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:28,269
in the mid-aughts
when america briefly lost interest in ska.

416
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:31,147
I don't have time.
I don't wanna listen to your music.

417
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,232
I don't wanna hang out.
Get out of here.

[Mr. Peanutbutter chuckles]

419
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,111
All right. You don't wanna listen
to bosstones together.

420
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:39,029
That's the impression that I get.

421
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:42,950
- Is it the impression that I get?
- Yes. That's the impression that you get.

422
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:44,118
[Todd yawns]

423
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:48,372
I see. Way to go, Mr. Peanutbutter.
What a stupid move. Why did you...?

424
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,000
[Snarling]

425
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:51,917
[Bojack groans]

426
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:56,505
Bojack, listen, I know you're scared,
but it's gonna be okay.

427
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,716
- You gotta be strong.
- Yeah, but...

428
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:03,137
You gotta rise to the occasion, okay?
So what if the new couch is weird?

429
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:04,472
- Or lumpy?
- Uh, what?

430
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,892
What are you gonna do?
Just sleep in bojack's car forever?

431
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:12,229
- Are you talking to me, or you...?
- Damn it, time to stop being a coward.

432
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:18,027
It's time to go home
and sleep on bojack's couch. Hurray!

433
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:20,112
Happy ending for Todd!

Charley Witherspoon, 28th floor agent.

437
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:37,463
Charley. Listen, I wanted to touch base
about Emily's start date on Jackie o.

438
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,381
Oh, yeah. Uh...

439
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:42,343
Well, we got some new screen tests

440
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:46,138
and, uh, goose decided to go
in a different direction.

441
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,475
Are you saying the Van sant camp
wants to recant on vancamp?

442
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:50,893
Because they can't.

443
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,772
Charley, you better get your client
to change his mind

444
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:58,484
- or I'll walk up to the 28th floor and...
- Just kidding.

445
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,445
- I can't get to the phone right now.
- What?

446
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:06,158
This is one of those answering machines
that sounds like it's Charley talking

447
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,744
but it's actually
just an answering machine.

448
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,080
- I know you're there, Charley.
- Leave a message.

449
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,123
- I'm not gonna leave a message.
- Beep.

Hey, Charley, Princess Carolyn again.

- Mailbox is full.
- What? Mailbox full?

452
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:20,589
- Error. Message deleted.
- Wait... no...

Rutabaga, this is not a good time.

458
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,435
Okay. Can I please just tell you
about the opera, though?

460
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:37,439
- How did you like the opera?
- I loved it.

461
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,984
Loved Tristan, loved isolde,
cried like a bunny.

462
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,152
Listen, my brain has been a-buzzing

463
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:45,072
for the past few days
thinking about that Jackie 0 movie.

464
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,783
I know it's your baby,
but I did make a few calls

465
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,369
and got my Rooney a screen test.

466
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,580
I put that movie together for my client.

467
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,416
No, no, no, don't freak out.
It's just a screen test.

468
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,835
But, honestly,
how fantaj would my Rooney be

469
00:22:58,002 --> 00:22:59,461
as a young Jackie bouv?

470
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:04,049
Stomp once for so fantaj,
twice for stupid-fantaj.

471
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:07,428

You're beautiful.

You can do it.

Only you hold the keys
to the house that is you.

00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,879
- Do you need more blood?
- I don't need blood.

488
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:44,715
- I read your book, bojack.
- 0h.

489
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:48,427
It takes a real narcissist to think
anyone wants to buy a book about him.

490
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,638
You know how I feel about Anne frank.

491
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,140
- That was a diary.
- [Mother] I read the parts about me.

492
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,435
The things I said to you.

493
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,687
You must think I'm a real monster.

494
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:01,440
- Mom...
- [Mother] I don't wanna fight you, bojack.

495
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:04,485
I just wanted to tell you I know.

496
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:07,655
I know you wanna be happy,
but you won't be, and...

497
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,783
- [Mother] I'm sorry.
- What?

498
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,452
It's not just you, you know.

499
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,037
Your father and I, we...

500
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:20,751
Well, you come by it honestly,
the ugliness inside you.

501
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:24,588
[Mother] You were born broken,
that's your birthright.

502
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:27,716
And now you can fill your life
with projects

503
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:31,136
your books and your movies
and your little girlfriends

504
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:34,056
but it won't make you whole.

505
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,600
[Mother] You're bojack horseman.

506
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:39,019
There's no cure for that.

507
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:43,816
Anyway, do you remember
who directed the Philadelphia story?

508
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:45,776
Five letters, second letter u?

509
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:51,657
- Lubitsch?
- [Sighs] No, bojack. Goodbye.

510
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,827
[Man on recording]
You need to visualize it

511
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:57,997
flying out the window, over the...

512
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,381
What are you doing here?

513
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:10,175
[Kelsey]
Great. We got it. Let's move on.

514
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,594
Back in the '905

515
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:17,641
I was in a very famous TV show

516
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,937
- I'm bojack the horse - bojack

517
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:26,066
bojack the horse
don't act like you don't know

518
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:32,781
and I'm trying to hold on to my past

519
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:37,494
it's been so long
I don't think I'm gonna last

520
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:41,707
I guess I 'ii just try
and make you understand

521
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:45,794
that I'm more horse than a man

522
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:50,591
or I'm more man than a horse

523
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:51,758
j“ bojack! J“

524
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,138
boxer versus raptor.
