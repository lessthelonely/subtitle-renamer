1
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:08,925
[Pickles] Okay, guys,
that is my cat eye tutorial.

2
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:11,803
It probably works better
if you're not a dog,

3
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:14,139
but anyways, like and subscribe.

4
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:17,517
Oh, and RIP Nelson Mandela
and Paul Walker.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,644
-[icon pops]
-Love you, sassy boys!

6
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:23,481
I just don't feel like
doing a makeup tutorial today.

7
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:26,234
-[whirring]
-Dad! I'm shooting a video!

8
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:27,193
[Franco] Demi!

9
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:30,030
I really thought me and Buzzy
were built to last,

10
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:33,408
like Brad and Angelina,
or Gwyneth and Coldplay Man,

11
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:36,828
or America and its current love affair
with Rebel Wilson.

12
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:40,290
[sighs] I'm sorry, I shouldn't be talking
about my personal life.

13
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,834
I just feel so alone.

14
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:45,378
-[icon pops]
-Aw! Thank you.

15
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,798
Hey, Pickle Pack!
Gettin' ready for another job interview.

16
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:52,635
I think I'm just gonna lie
about having experience. Right?

17
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,806
I got the job! I'm a systems analyst?

18
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,393
I got fired my first day
as a systems analyst,

19
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:04,230
but then I got a job
as an air traffic controller!

20
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:07,776
I got fired my first day
as an air traffic controller.

21
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:10,528
But then I got a job as a waitress!

22
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:13,198
-So, I've been seeing someone.
-[icon pops]

23
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:17,535
He's a yellow lab,
and he's so handsome and friendly.

24
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:18,828
[barks and licks]

25
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,872
-Mister asked me to move in with him!
-[icons pop]

26
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:24,834
-Hi, Mister!
-Oh, are you taking a video? [laughs]

27
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:28,213
Thank you, queefburglar69,
for that lovely cartoon heart!

28
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:32,342
Get a load of this cool house,
Pickle Pack! Lights, off. Lights, on!

29
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,803
-[giggles]
-Thank you, Robot House!

30
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,763
Check this out. The Thunder Room.

31
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:39,891
A place to wait out thunderstorms
and Fourth of July celebrations!

32
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:41,267
Thunder door, close!

33
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:44,270
[automated voice] Closing. [clunks]
Thunder Room secure.

34
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,438
Cute!

35
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:51,069
He got down on one knee and everything!
He was so nervous before he asked!

36
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:53,404
-Of course I said yes!
-[icons pop]

37
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:58,701
-I think Mister is still in shock!
-Engaged! That's what we are now!

38
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,745
Ring filter!

39
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,413
So, I guess I liked the play.

40
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:05,041
I was just surprised at how different
it was from the movie.

41
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,793
I kept waiting for the baseball part.

42
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:11,256
And so many dysfunctional relationships!
All the cheating and lying!

43
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:14,676
[sighs] I'm sure glad we're not like that,
right, Mister?

44
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,971
Um, Pickles, would you mind
turning off the livestream?

45
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,807
There's something I need
to discuss with you. Privately.

46
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,310
Ooh, I hope it's something good!

47
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,355
-[beeps]
-[sobbing]

48
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:32,152
-The wedding is off! [crying]
-[icons popping]

49
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,237
[theme music playing]

50
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,376
-[brakes squeak]
-[crickets chirping]

51
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,503
[exhales]

52
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,505
Hi, I'm here to see BoJack.

53
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,841
You're... [hisses] too late.

54
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,552
-What?
-He's... [hisses] gone...

55
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,554
-No!
-...to a party for the night.

56
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,473
Here's the address.
Sorry for all the wincing.

57
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:46,559
I put too many jalapeÃ±os
on my... [hisses] sandwich.

58
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,269
A party? With alcohol?

59
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,772
No, a lame party, without alcohol.

60
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,023
Uh...

61
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:55,151
Don't worry. We sent him
with a trained sober companion.

62
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,903
He'll keep him out of trouble.

63
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,824
This is Eduardo.
He's here to keep me out of trouble.

64
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,911
[chuckles] Say, aren't you
one of those fainting goats?

65
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,788
[laughs] Only if I panic.

66
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,206
So, what makes you panic?

67
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:11,501
Nothing. The whole point is
he doesn't panic. Sober companion.

68
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,044
You know what makes me panic?

69
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:16,172
Most of the time
I'm an ocean-levels-rising guy,

70
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,632
but sometimes I like to dwell

71
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:20,635
on the fact that
there will always be invisible walls

72
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:23,846
between myself and those who claim
to know me.

73
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:28,476
[chuckles] That sure is nerve-racking,
but the only thing that makes me panic

74
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,812
is the thought
that I might someday drink again.

75
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:34,565
-A toast to that never happening!
-[whimpers and thuds]

76
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,776
Very helpful. Thank you, Eduardo.

77
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:41,531
Oh, I'm just Greg, a guy Mr. Peanutbutter
met at a gas station once.

78
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,075
I honestly don't even know
why I got invited to this party.

79
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,243
[Ruthie crying]

80
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,578
You know, I got a few TV ideas myself.

81
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:52,417
[chuckles] Franco, nobody wants to hear
your time-travelling orthodontist pitch!

82
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,296
Demi, you are lighting a long fuse
on a short stick of dynamite.

83
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,257
Oh, whoop. And a big one at that.

84
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:02,593
[inhales, exhales]

85
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,680
-Diane! Didn't think I'd see you here!
-[screams]

86
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:08,474
Could you go tell BoJack to come out
so I can talk to him?

87
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,894
What? I don't have time
for your classic Diane wackiness.

88
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,980
We gotta get these to the balloon room!

89
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,025
-[coos]
-[screams]

90
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,986
-Hey.
-Hey, look who's back in town!

91
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,030
-[groans]
-Wow! Baby! Cute!

92
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,948
-[giggling]
-She's crawling all over the place.

93
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:27,076
I wasn't gonna bring her out,
but another nanny quit on me.

94
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,536
Carlotta quit, huh?

95
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,538
I assume she resigned in disgrace

96
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:33,791
for not making good airplane noises
when she feeds Ruthie?

97
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:37,253
No, she said she felt
she was being watched all day.

98
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:41,299
Impossible! I'm there around the clock,
observing her every move.

99
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:44,802
-If she was being watched, I'd know!
-Uh-huh.

100
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,140
Uh, where do these balloons go?

101
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,894
Hello, Pickles' best friend Ilana.

102
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:56,356
Pickles' other friend Ilana.
Didn't think I'd see you here.

103
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,650
And then of course, there's always
the looming fear my spleen

104
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,235
could up and re-twist itself.

105
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,446
How are we back in a conversation?

106
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,448
It's like I'm trying to canoe out to sea

107
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,368
but the current keeps washing me back
to the same shallow backwater.

108
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,953
-Hey, there you are.
-Thank God, I'm so glad you're here.

109
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,663
-Never leave my side.
-I have to tell you--

110
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:16,876
-Okay, everybody get to your places!
-What's happening?

111
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,088
Mr. Peanutbutter's and Pickles'
surprise wedding!

112
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,506
Surprise wedding?

113
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:24,092
The wedding planning
was stressing Mr. Peanutbutter out,

114
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:27,553
and Pickles loves big romantic surprises.

115
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,098
And I'm not doing much
except for sitting at home

116
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,433
watching Princess Carolyn's
terrible nannies,

117
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:35,853
so naturally I thought,
"Ooh! Surprise wedding!"

118
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:38,231
-Where are they now?
-I got them two tickets

119
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,982
to Angels in the Outfield.

120
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:43,486
-The movie?
-The play. It's like six hours long.

121
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,530
Do you mean Angels in America?

122
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:49,117
Whatever it is,
after that feel-good comedy,

123
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,411
they'll be in a great mood for a wedding!

124
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,830
Wow. Okay...

125
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,791
Look, I cannot be here.
Just... I'm moving.

126
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,876
Great, your apartment's a dump.
Where are you moving to?

127
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,003
Uh, not Echo Park. I'll never see you.

128
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,881
-Chicago.
-Chicago? "Chicago" Chicago?

129
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,675
Ooh, they just pulled into the driveway!

130
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,719
-Shit! Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!
-Why Chicago?

131
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,681
Everybody hide and stay quiet.

132
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,766
[slapping and groaning]

133
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:18,688
Remember, as soon as the lights go on,
just jump up and yell, "Surprise!"

134
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,648
-Lights, off!
-[lights beep]

135
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,737
Um, Pickles? Would you mind
turning off the livestream?

136
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,615
There's something I need
to discuss with you. Privately.

137
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,577
Ooh, I hope it's something good!

138
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,954
It's not.

139
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,080
-Lights--
-Wait!

140
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,832
Before Robot House assaults us

141
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:40,960
with the harsh unforgiving glare
of our energy-efficient bulbs,

142
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,336
I need to tell you this.

143
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,963
But it's so dark in here.

144
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,923
What I'm about to confess is so shameful,

145
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,342
I can only admit it
in the cover of shadow.

146
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,386
Don't be silly. Lights, on!

147
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,096
-I cheated on you!
-[man] Surp--!

148
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,098
-[man shushes]
-Did someone just say something?

149
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,766
Don't change the subject!

150
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,895
-[voice breaking] You cheated on me?
-I am so sorry.

151
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,607
-How could you do this?
-It was the worst mistake of my life!

152
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,026
And I once played Twister
with Bryan Singer

153
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,737
at Kevin Spacey's party
for Andy Dick's early parole.

154
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,198
-Ugh!
-I've been in the Thunder Room every night

155
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,283
for months trying to swallow my shame.

156
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:15,661
But I can't. And I've apparently been
so racked with guilt I left the door open.

157
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,206
-Thunder door, close.
-[automated voice] Closing. [clunks]

158
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,248
Thunder Room secure.

159
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,334
[muffled voice] Help! Please!

160
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:24,712
Just because you feel guilty,
that doesn't make it okay.

161
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,340
Are you the time I went to see
Lady Gaga in concert

162
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,966
and she didn't sing "Paparazzi"?

163
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,345
Because I am hurt,
and I am confused, and I am angry,

164
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:35,640
and nobody told me there was going to be
an encore, so I just went home and...

165
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,391
-[groans]
-Why am I even talking to you?

166
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,144
-I need my best friend. I'm calling Ilana!
-[gasps]

167
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:45,650
But, honestly,
can Ilana even relate to me anymore?

168
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,277
Since she got that
new Sunday-to-Thursday job

169
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,572
she's turned into a real
See-You-Next-Friday.

170
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,032
I never thought I'd say this,

171
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:56,911
but sometimes I feel like I prefer
my other friend Ilana.

172
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:00,540
Sometimes it's just easier to talk
to a person who has nothing else going on.

173
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,667
-What?
-Please don't tell the Ilanas about this.

174
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,087
I'm gonna tell everybody about this.
I'm a Gemini.

175
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:10,174
No! Think of my family!
They need me to be strong right now.

176
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,676
Poor Captain Peanutbutter.

177
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,135
He recently confided to me

178
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,972
he feels trapped in a loveless marriage
with Mrs. Captain Peanutbutter.

179
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:19,308
-[laughs awkwardly]
-Well, can you blame her?

180
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,351
Excuse me?

181
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,645
Every time I get trapped
in a conversation with Captain,

182
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,231
I think, "If I was married to this guy,

183
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:28,693
I would gnaw my own hand off
just to get the ring off my body."

184
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,611
At least no one in my family
has anger issues.

185
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:34,448
My father has come so far
with his anger management classes!

186
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:38,703
I'm sorry, but your father is a hot head
with a little pug complex.

187
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:41,372
-Everyone makes excuses for his outbursts.
-[snarling]

188
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,999
"I don't know what's gotten into Franco.

189
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,667
-He's not usually like that."
-[shushes]

190
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,254
-Trust me. He's like that.
-How dare you.

191
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:51,841
And the way your mother provokes him!
I think they get off on it,

192
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,428
and they're making us unwilling
participants in their kinky foreplay.

193
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,597
Ew! Those are my parents!

194
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,224
-And don't even get me started on Greg.
-[shushes]

195
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,102
That guy that I met once
at that gas station!

196
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,522
-Why are you bringing him up?
-I don't know, but he sucks, too!

197
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,025
-Oh.
-There, I got it off my chest.

198
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,152
I know who I need right now.

199
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,112
No, Pickles. Please don't TweedFeed this.

200
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,239
I understand your Pickle Pack
is part of how you process pain.

201
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:19,368
Wrong, Mister Mister.
The Pack isn't part of anything.

202
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,911
They are everything.

203
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,789
When I stabbed myself in the eye
with a boba straw,

204
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:27,877
they all sent me photos
of themselves wearing eyepatches.

205
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,046
And when my Grandma Piccolino died,

206
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:35,760
stickyvicki was the first person
to say "LMAO. Sorry for your loss."

207
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:39,388
My subscribers are with me
through thick and thin.

208
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:44,477

00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,487
so much practical application in my life,

213

but you could tie some sheets together
and make a rope.

-[Pickles] No! You stay!

-Oh, fish!

00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:58,217
I mean, I've been hurt by guys before.
But this, I just feel so stupid.

-[text pops]
-My God, thank you, not even.

233
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:05,391
[knocks]
Hi. I know you are quite upset, but--

234
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:08,477
Are you not listening?
I told you to leave me alone.

235
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,730
-Right, but--
-Oh! You want a makeup tutorial?

236
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,691
Here's a makeup tutorial:
We are never making up!

237
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,735
-Wha--
-Door, slam!

238
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:20,698
Okay. Here's how to look
like a crying, pugly freak!

239
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,535
[Pickles] So, you're gonna want a mascara
that really runs...

240
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,078
-So, why Chicago?
-What?

241
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,330
What's the draw?
Is it the rampant gun violence?

242
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,834
Or do you just like seeing improv actors
who aren't good enough for LA?

243
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,170
-Or is there a guy?
-Uh...

244
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,464
What's his name, your suitor?
Your gentleman caller?

245
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,883
-Guy.
-Fine. What's your guy's name?

246
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:42,803
No. Guy is the name of the guy
I'm not moving to Chicago for.

247
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,598
What's the name of the guy
you are moving to Chicago for?

248
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:46,766
I think we're done here.

-Ruthie.
-This is all your fault.

If you hadn't creeped out
every nanny I hire--

252
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:00,571
I wouldn't have to monitor them so closely
if you hadn't hired a bunch of quacks!

253
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,239
Ooh! Duck! [grunts]

[Mr. Peanutbutter whimpering]

255
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,661
What's with all this mid-century furniture
so close to the ground?

256
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:11,582
-No one had to hide in the '50s?
-Close to the ground, that's it!

257
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:14,001
We've gotta think like a baby!

258
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,170
I'm a baby. I don't have a job.

259
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,798
I love being wrapped up
in soft, red hoodies.

260
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,884
And when I'm feeling low,
I like to get high.

-I'll be right down!

277
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,760
Okay, Pickle Pack,
let's pick out an outfit.

278
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,888
What says, "I am going to survive this
because I am strong,

279
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,224
-but you should still feel very bad"?
-Uh...

280
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:14,562
-Go, baby! Go to mama! Oh.
-[giggles]

281
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:20,484
But what if we go for a walk and he says
all the right things and I forgive him?

282
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,237
I can't make it so easy for him, can I?

283
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,613
Oh, my God.

284
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:28,409
That is an even better idea, MarciFartz.

285
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:31,245
Hey, Mister!
Cancel the park and come here.

286
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,789
What? Stay out of my shit, MarciFartz!

287

Exactly the way I like it.

290

Then we'll talk.

and drag them online.

00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,749
[scoffs] Impossible.

330
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,798
Uh...

331
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,760
There's no clear path to the exit.
You can wait it out, I'm doing the window.

332
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,138
It's not because of me
that you're moving to Chicago?

333
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,140
No. I need to go.

334
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:59,143
[Mr. Peanutbutter] Pickles? Precious?
Possible point of complexity...

335
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,936
Son of a bitch.

336
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,979
[grunting]

337
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,148
...I know your favorite drink is boba,

338
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,025
but just the other day, you said,

339
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,402
"Whipped cream
is the best thing in the world"

340
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,946
immediately followed by,
and this is a direct quote,

341
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,907
"So, keep it as far away
from me as possible!"

342
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,868
I just wanted to circle back.

343
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,622
[music playing over earbuds]

344
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,041
Yeah.

345
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,167
Don't get me wrong,

346
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,545
I love the challenge of trying
to square two irreconcilable positions.

347
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,006
-Where's the baby? There's the baby!
-[giggling]

348
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,800
Where's the baby?
[gasps] Shit! Where's the baby?

349
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:34,428
[glass shatters]

350
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:37,056
Bang-crash, you say! I hear the note.

351
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:41,560
I'll be right back with your drink
prepared exactly the way you want it!

352
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,021
[Princess Carolyn grunts]

353
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,816
Here.

354
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,070
-You know how in AA they give you chips?
-But no salsa?

355
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,362
Using that.

356
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,490
But they're a big deal, the chips.

357
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,743
Sure, they brainwash you into thinking
they're more important than they are,

358
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,995
but when I got my two-month chip...

359
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,500
I thought, "I wish Diane could see this."

360
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,252
I see it. It's amazing.

361
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,797
It would not be improved by salsa.

362
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:11,673
[Pickles] Door, open!

363
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:17,137
[both gasp, grunting]

364
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,347
No! No!

365
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,892
-[BoJack scoffs]
-[Pickles humming]

366
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,060
Hmm.

367
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:29,024
Sunshine, I have your boba.

368
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,859
[Pickles] No whipped cream, I hope.

369
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,111
Of course not.

370
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,946
You always know how I like it.

371
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,156
Is there any chance we could talk IRL?

372
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,033
Intimately, rigorously, lengthily?

373
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,535
[inhales, exhales]

374
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:44,206
You know, what's funny
is now I actually want the whipped cream.

375
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,126
Well, good news, because, uh...

376
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,712
-Hmm...
-I don't want to be mad at you.

377
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,713
That's great!

378
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,924
-No, it's not--
-I know I caused you pain,

379
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:57,344
but we can get through this.
I still wanna marry you.

380
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,013
Do you still want to marry me?

381
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,268
Promise me you'll never lie to me again?

382
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,769
I promise.

383
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:11,275
Then I guess we could put it behind us
if it just happened the one time.

384
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,528
It did! One time! One unit of cheating.

385
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,738
Comprised of two separate instances.

386
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,408
-What?
-But the spirit of it was once.

387
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,786
Well, at least you told me right away.

388
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,706
-It happened a few months ago.
-What?

389
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:29,209
-But I'm being honest with you now!
-Okay.

390
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,754
-At least it wasn't with someone I know.
-It was Diane.

391
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:36,508
Diane, the nice lady
from the chew toy store?

392
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,051
Diane, my ex-wife?

393
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,429
That's so much worse!

394
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,432
You are a bad dog!

395
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:47,936
-No. No. No!

[crying continues]

399
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:06,079
Come on, Eduardo. Hold it together.
You're not just a fainting goat.

400
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:11,084
You're a trained sober companion.
Just do what the sign says.

401
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,047
No! [thuds]

-Vacuum, stop.
-[automated voice] Stopping.

Coin sorter, sort. [tinkling]

406
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:34,233
Oh, Coin Sorter,
I'd love to toss my problems in a tray

407
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:37,736
and say, "Here, sort these out."
I know it doesn't work that way,

408
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:42,199
but if only this smart house
could give some advice to this stupid dog.

409
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,826
-[BoJack imitates robot] Go to her.
-Coin Sorter?

410
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,579
Go to Pickles. Go now.

411
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:51,458
I don't know, Coin Sorter.
I've already screwed everything up so bad.

412
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,835
I should sit here
and wait for her to come to me.

413
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:57,297
No. You go to her. Leave this room.

414
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,092
-Okay.
-[imitates robot] But don't talk so much!

415
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:04,888
-What?
-It is I, the robot, uh, thermostat.

416
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,057
Thermostat, I should have known.

417
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,226
I can always count on you
to cool things down

418
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,894
when they get too heated.
You were saying?

419
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,230
Sometimes you try to fix problems

420
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:16,984
or make them go away,
which comes off as dismissive.

421
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,487
If you want to solve this, listen.
Really hear her.

422
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,364
Beep-boop. Seventy-two degrees.

423
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,824
Okay.

424
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:28,829
[both sigh, grunt]

425
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,542
[normal voice] Is this mess
why you're moving to Chicago?

426
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,335
[normal voice] I told you,
I'm moving for me.

427
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:36,336
I get it.

428
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,839
-Are you gonna be okay?
-Yeah.

429
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:42,384
-I mean... I don't know.
-You seem okay.

430
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:45,304
But the reason I had to tell you
I was leaving,

431
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,015
the reason I came
to my ex-husband's house,

432
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,851
was because I need to know
that you're gonna be okay.

433
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,394
I need to hear you say it.

434
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:55,939
I can't leave if I don't know
you're going to be okay, BoJack.

435
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,691
-I'll be okay.
-Promise?

436
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:59,776
Because if something happens,
and I'm in Chicago--

437
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,155
That's not a friendship,
that's a hostage situation.

438
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,574
Go to Chicago. I'll be fine.

Would you wanna be her nanny?

I do know her routine

like Cameron Diaz

I don't want to be mad at you.

456
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,796
It sucks that I have to be mad at you.

457
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,465
This should be
the happiest time of my life,

458
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:08,512
but now because you did something stupid,
I have to feel bad.

459
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,055
That's not fair.

460
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:15,769
And I still love you and...
[sighs] I still wanna marry you.

461
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,480
But you can't do things
that hurt me like that.

462
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,148
It's not okay.

463
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:23,527
And if we just go back
to the way things were before

464
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:27,280
and pretend nothing happened,
I'm gonna feel stupid.

465
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,241
We can't just go back.

466
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,451
How can we make this right?

467
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:34,454
Don't just stand there!
I'm talking to you.

468
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:39,000
I'm sorry. I want us to stay together.
I want you to trust me.

469
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:42,003
I wanna make us even somehow.

470
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,506
Even? The only logical way to be even

471
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,050
would be if I got to sleep
with somebody else.

472
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,927
Okay. If that's what needs to happen.

473
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,388
-Really?
-Yeah, we just have to think who--

474
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,140
Buzzy. My high school boyfriend, Buzzy.

475
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:55,058
Very quick with that name, but okay. Fine.

476
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,768
No, you don't even know him.

477
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,520
Knowing is what hurts the most.

478
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:02,816
What if I sleep with Buzzy and Tyler
from Soul Cycle?

479
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:06,570
-Two people?
-Well, maybe we can keep brainstorming.

480
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:07,779
If we put our heads together,

481
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,991
I know we'll find the perfect guy
for you to cheat on me with

482
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,284
that makes it totally even,

483
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:15,245
so things can go back to normal
and we can get married.

484
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:17,956

-Hey, guys.
-Diane?

486
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:24,880
I'm just here to randomly apologize
for that time we cheated on Pickles twice.

487
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:28,133
It was a big mistake and it was my fault
and it will never happen again.

488
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:29,801
Also, I think I left my wallet here

489
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,012
when I came to your party
a year and a half ago.

490
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:34,639
If you find it, probably under the bed
in the master suite,

491
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,601
could you mail it to me?
I live in Chicago now. Thanks.

This is Eduardo. Don't mind him.
He's just keeping me sober.

00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:51,114
-Oh, my parents are calling.
-Fun! Put 'em on speaker!

497
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:58,622
âª Back in the 90s
I was in a very famous TV show âª

498
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,876
-âª I'm BoJack the Horseman âª
-âª BoJack âª

499
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:07,380
âª BoJack the Horseman
Don't act like you don't know âª

500
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:14,304
âª And I'm trying to hold on to my past âª

501
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:18,975
âª It's been so long
I don't think I'm gonna last âª

502
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:22,729
âª I guess I'm just trying
To make you understand âª

503
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:26,983
âª That I'm more horse than a man âª

504
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:32,822
âª Or I'm more man than a horse âª
-âª BoJack! âª
