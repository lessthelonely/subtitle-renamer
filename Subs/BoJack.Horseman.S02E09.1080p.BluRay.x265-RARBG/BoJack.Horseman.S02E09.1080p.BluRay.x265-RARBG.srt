1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,095
Sir, you can't send me to Vietnam.

2
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,972
[Nixon] I can do whatever I want.

3
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:17,601
I'm president of the goddamn
United States of America.

4
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:19,311
Isn't that right, checkers?

5
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:21,647
That's what it says
on your business cards.

6
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:25,567
There are going to be riots
in the streets.

7
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,110
I'm secretariat.

8
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,279
You think I'm afraid
of a few rioting hippies?

9
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:32,199
Don't make me laugh. Ha-hoo.

10
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,284
Or whatever a laugh sounds like.

11
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,119
Please, I'll do anything.

12
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,247
You gotta send someone else
in my place.

13
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:44,294
Hmm. Perhaps an arrangement can be...
Arranged.

14
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:51,176
I'm just an athlete. I'm no hero.
My brother jeffretariat is the hero.

15
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:53,262
He's fighting the reds over in 'nam,

16
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:56,265
which is necessary
to protect our way of life.

17
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:59,434
And another hero is president Nixon.

18
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:03,063
He is one groovy dude.

19
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,400
[Bojack] Groovy.

20
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:09,778
[Coughing]

21
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,072
What the hell are you doing?

22
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,239
Sorry, mommy!

23
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:14,658
Don't you dare put that out.

24
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:18,704
That is a perfectly good cigarette,
and you are going to finish it.

25
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,038
But I don't wanna.

26
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,291
And I don't want to be
the mother of a quitter.

27
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,042
Finish it.

28
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,209
[Coughing]

29
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,713
Jesus Christ, you can't even smoke
a cigarette right.

30
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:31,216
Don't you dare cry,
don't you ever cry.

31
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:32,383
You wanted this.

32
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,721
Are you punishing me for smoking
or for stealing?

33
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,390
I'm punishing you for being alive.

34
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:48,317
Uh, bojack? You really shouldn't throw
a lit cigarette off the...

35
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,483
[Fire roaring]

36
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,903
Fine. I'll call 911.

37
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,545
The fire department got
everything under control,

38
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,506
but the cable's out
for the neighborhood.

39
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,633
I don't understand
what started the fire.

40
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,653
Nobody knows where fires come from,
it's a mystery.

41
00:02:56,677 --> 00:03:00,347
Anyway, I am fired up
about my first day back on set.

42
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,307
We're gonna finish
that big Nixon scene.

43
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,810
We were just one shot away
before we went on hiatus.

44
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,937
Yeah, I know.
You told me at breakfast.

45
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,229
Why did you call me?

46
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,035
Usually I talk to Diane
on the way to work,

47
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,859
but she abandoned me to teach piano
in cordovia or something.

48
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,530
Oh. Well, glad you settled for me
because Diane wasn't available.

49
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:19,491
You bet. Oh, man, I'm gonna kill
in this Nixon scene.

50
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:22,244
Bojack gonna be in "da" house.

51
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:23,829
In da white house.

52
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,708
What happened to da house set?
Da white house set?

53
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,252
- Things changed a little.
- You cut the Nixon scene?

54
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,462
The Nixon scene is the core
of the whole movie.

55
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,881
Where we see secretariat
be morally corrupted

56
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,384
and get to look
into the real darkness of his soul.

57
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,678
It's still all that,
except now it happens

58
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,765
while you give a Christmas present
to your nieces

59
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,224
and they hug you
while your butt is stuck in a chimney.

60
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,851
Is one of the nieces Nixon?

61
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,686
Over hiatus, we ran a focus group.

62
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:50,230
People don't want
all that controversial stuff.

63
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:53,358
But we were supposed to make
a gritty movie about the real secretariat.

64
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,861
- Warts and all.
- Kid, "warts and all" don't pay bubkes.

65
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,488
That's why they took the gay stuff
out of a beautiful mind.

66
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,615
And that guy who spent 12 years
as a slave?

67
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,577
They don't talk about the 60 years
he spent as a jerk.

68
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,454
- Kelsey, you're okay with this?
- Ah.

69
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,620
That's showbiz.

70
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:09,207
See, bojack,
that's the shrug of a pro who gets it.

71
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,834
Good shrugging, kid.

72
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:15,338
Care-to-the-o-to-the-iyn-to-the...

73
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,265
That's the end of your name.
We need to talk.

74
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,593
We'll meet in the supply closet
in one minute. Break!

75
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,470
Oh, okay.

76
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:22,636
Ooh, ow.

77
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:26,558
Carolyn, when you're in the throes
of a very ugly divorce such as I am,

78
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:30,645
along with all that pain and degradation
comes a certain perfect clarity,

79
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:35,817
and right now that clarity is telling me
that you and I should get out of here.

80
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,403
Well, what do you mean,
"get out of here"?

81
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:42,866
Beautiful, I'm starting my own agency,
and I want you to be my partner in crime.

82
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,076
What? But I can't just leave vigor.

83
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:46,661
I've been here 20 years.

84
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,330
Who's gonna water the plants?

85
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:49,937
Um, I'm sorry. You water the plants?

86
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,583
I started doing it as an intern,

87
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,503
but then no one told me to stop,
so it's still kind of my job.

88
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,255
Carolyn,
you are my gritty, witty city kitty.

89
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,299
I want you with me, fifty-fifty.

90
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,635
Things are so crazy
for me right now. I...

91
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:05,430
Don't give me that, you want crazy.
"Crazy" is your favorite patsy cline song

92
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,557
and your second favorite
gnarls barkley song.

93
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:08,724
I don't want crazy.

94
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:12,354
I've got five episodes
of the good wife piled up on my dvr,

95
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,773
and I just want a night off
to enjoy them.

96
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,693
Well, if that's how you feel, I guess
I could just go to Vanessa gekko.

97
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,280
- [Carolyn] Gekko?!
- But I'd rather look at you all day.

98
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:26,117
You're an amazing agent.
And you're bright, and you're fun.

99
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:29,746
And I think we could make something
really special.

100
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:32,958
We weren't doing anything!
We were just looking for closet supplies.

101
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:36,545
Are you the person to talk to
about unclogging the toilet?

102
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:37,963
Stuart, I'm your boss.

103
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:41,341
Okay, but you're the one
in the janitor's closet, so...

104
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,552
What, I'm the idiot?

105
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,766
[Diane] The first thing you notice
about Sebastian St. Clair

106
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,476
is that he speaks in paragraphs.

107
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,937
Even I can't believe
how much good we've done here,

108
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,647
and I'll believe almost anything.

109
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:58,650
In the last six weeks,
we dug a new well, built a school,

110
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:01,653
and next month
the community center is doing seussical.

111
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,820
There we go.

112
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,739
[Diane] In his previous life,
Sebastian owned

113
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,491
a chain of high-end department stores.

114
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:08,159
I want to stock up on muffs.

115
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,705
We're going to sell a lot of muffs
this winter. Huzzah!

116
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,833
Diane, I lived a life
of power and luxury,

117
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,793
and then my picture
was in the newspaper.

118
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,628
- A real-life newspaper!
- Uh-huh.

119
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,547
But I knew my life was empty.

120
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,550
At night I heard the cries
of children sick and dying.

121
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,385
And I would scream into the night.

122
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,846
Shut up! Shut up, children!

123
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:30,807
But the phantom cries would not abate.

124
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,601
And so I began my travels,

125
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,048
with little more than a compass,
a yearning for adventure,

126
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,980
and several crates full of unsold muffs.

127
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:40,483
I knew there were people out there
just waiting for my help.

128
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,527
Diane, this is kinko.

129
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:43,694
I am kinko.

130
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,988
In his language, it means,

131
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:47,782
orphan whose parents were murdered
by rebels and will die young,

132
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,409
probably from malaria.

133
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:50,952
Hi, kinko. I'm Diane.

134
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,747
It means,
my parents liked the show cheers.

135
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:58,043
Cheers! Oh, you're good.
You're very good.

136
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,169
[Diane] When Sebastian St. Clair says
you're good,

137
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,963
you want to believe
that you really are.

138
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,675
That you, like Sebastian, are part
of something bigger than just yourself.

139
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:09,012
And for a moment,
you feel like you are.

140
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,931
[Sebastian] Kinko made a mess.

141
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:17,520
Now I finally realize that a triple hug is
way more valuable than a triple crown.

142
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,606
And cut. Neat.

143
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,775
- Let's break for lunch.
- [All] Oh!

144
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,028
Kelsey, this is a nightmare.

145
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:28,073
I had to touch three children today,
and one of them was sticky.

146
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,533
Yeah, it was you.
Wash your damn hands, you gremlin.

147
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,411
- Bojack, there's nothing we can do.
- No, this isn't you.

148
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,913
I've seen everything you've done.

149
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,582
Your films are challenging and gritty,
and they're great.

150
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,019
I'm not just saying that
because they're full of lesbians.

151
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,504
Look, even if I wanted to finish
that Nixon scene,

152
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,589
we don't have an oval office set.

153
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,636
There's one at the Nixon library
in yorba Linda.

154
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,551
Why on earth do you know that?

155
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,988
In season three of horsin'around,
the horse got elected president

156
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,180
and we shot on location.

157
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,100
We can sneak into the library
and get the shot, guerilla-style.

158
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,786
Once turteltaub sees it,
he'll love it,

159
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:59,437
and we can make the movie
we both want to make.

160
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,605
[Sighs]

161
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:03,775
- Okay, I'm in. Let's do it.
- All right!

162
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,111
Did they really make
your character president?

163
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,277
Only for season three.

164
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,698
In season four, it turned out
it was all a dream.

165
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,908
They called my airplane air horse one.

166
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,703
And the vice president was
a hip-hop zebra named zebro.

167
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,538
- Come on.
- It wasn't our best season.

168
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:18,915
But on the bright side,
it was not our worst.

169
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,752
Step one, we go to the Nixon library

170
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,796
and steal the scale model.

171
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,923
[Man as Nixon] Welcome to my library.

172
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,175
I'm Nixon. [Chuckles].

173
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,887
[In normal voice] Yeah, you know,
some people say I look like Nixon.

174
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:36,725
Not because he's my dad or anything.
That's crazy. Nixon's not my dad.

175
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:40,228
But if you have any questions about Nixon,
I'd be happy to answer them.

176
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,939
Yeah, I have a question. Um...

177
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:46,651
Is that the lighted exit sign
from Nixon's boyhood home?

178
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,487
Uh, no, that's just an exit sign.

179
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,822
- Is that...
- Here we go.

180
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,950
The handicapped drinking fountain
he used in the white house?

181
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,785
No, just a normal drinking fountain.

182
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:56,952
- Hang on.
- One more.

183
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,289
- Is that the smoke alarm...?
- No.

184
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,999
[Nervously chuckles]

185
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,086
So the oval office is right here,
next to the men's room.

186
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,315
I remember because season three of
horsin'around was a big cocaine year for me.

187
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,008
All the pressures of being president.

188
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:13,553
- I don't see how we can pull this off.
- We're gonna need a crack team.

189
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,514
First, we gotta get
the best lock-pick in the city.

190
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,017
- Not interested.
- Okay.

191
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,894
The second best lock-pick in the city.

192
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,937
- No way I'm doing that.
- Got it.

193
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,104
A lock-pick.

194
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,565
Todd, can you pick locks?

195
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,650
- Kind of.
- Great. You're in.

196
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,177
We 'ii need an expert cat burglar.

197
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,571
All right, good wife,
let's see what you got.

198
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,073
[Bojack] Hey, Princess Carolyn!

199
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,909
Kelsey and I are gonna break
into the Nixon library

200
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,661
to steal a shot
for our secretariat movie.

201
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:43,625
It's a super-sneaky, kooky caper
that stands to benefit you in no way.

202
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:44,792
Are you in?

203
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,628
[Man] Hey! Shut up down there!

204
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:48,230
- [Bojack] You shut up!
- [Man] Make me!

205
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,673
[Bojack] Hey, you got a problem?
Take it up with my agent,

206
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,759
your downstairs neighbor
Princess Carolyn.

207
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:53,926

208
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,304
[Bojack]
We 'ii need someone to play checkers.

209
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,015
Hey, Chicago! Al Capone, deep dish.

210
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:02,602
What does Ethan hawke know?
We'll find out tonight. Da bears.

211
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,229
Bojack, I'd love to help you out,

212
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,147
but I'm super-busy recording promos

213
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,358
for television's
highest-rated new game show.

214
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,694
- We can probably do it without you.
- This next one's for Seattle.

215
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,823
Hey, Seattle! Space needle, Starbucks.

216
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:18,243
What does Ethan hawke know?
We'll find out tonight. Rain.

217
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:21,746
It's too bad though because I could
really bring a lot to this project.

218
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,958
The more I think about it,
checkers wouldn't even be in the shot.

219
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,668
It's just a single on secretariat.

220
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:30,630
Hey, waco, Texas! Terrible tragedy.
What does Ethan hawke know?

221
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,967
- We'll find out tonight. So sorry.
- You know what? Forget I even asked.

222
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,761
- Twist my arm, why don't you? I'll do it.
- Okay.

223
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,365
Finally, we 'ii need a criminal mastermind.

224
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,725
Character actress margo martindale,
you've been a model prisoner.

225
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,394
I'm glad I served my time.

226
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,437
But now I'm ready to move on with my life

227
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,273
and get back to doing small roles

228
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:51,025
in critically-acclaimed films
and television shows.

229
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,904

for best guest actress.

231
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,039
I need your help with a break-in.

232
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:08,042
Bojack, I've been out of prison
for two minutes.

233
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,919
What took you so long?

234
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,838
[Tires squealing]

235
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:16,426
Kelsey, Mr. Peanutbutter and I
are gonna break into the library.

236
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:19,637
But the problem is,
the place is crawling with cops.

237
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:20,972
They're on high alert

238
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:24,184
because some idiot
stole this model last night.

239
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,644
Yeah, nice work, Todd.

240
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:30,815
[Laughs] Who am I kidding?
I can't stay mad. You're adorable.

241
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:34,736
Look at your big saucer eyes.
I can go swimming in them!

242
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,155
- Totally.
- Now, we need to lose the cops.

243
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,115
The rest of you will create a diversion

244
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:43,161
by breaking into the only other place
in yorba Linda of cultural significance:

245
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,747
The discount fine art gallery
in the strip mall,

246
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,082
between the tanning salon
and the adult bookstore.

247
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,752
Once you set off the alarm,
all the cops will go there.

248
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,754
[Mimicking siren wails and engine revving]

249
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:57,342
Now, things could get ugly.
One of you is very likely to die.

250
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:00,220
- Possibly Alan.
- Why possibly Alan?

251
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,430
You are the guy
none of us knows that well.

252
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,265
I just came to fix your cable.

253
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:07,685
You already know too much.
You're a part of this now, like it or not.

254
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,146
- But...
- Hey, you think you could keep it down?

255
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:13,107
I'm reading a script
and I'm having trouble focusing,

256
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,360
so now my notes are
gonna be confusing and vague.

257
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:16,319
We're almost done.

258
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,326
I know you're having fun
with your police cars,

259
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,783
I just wish you would have asked
before you invited these people over.

260
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,035
- I live here, too.
- You're right. I'm sorry.

261
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:26,913
And can you at least let Alan
fix the cable before he dies?

262
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,416
I can't die. I'm endangered!

[Sebastian] Diane,

270
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,563
I'm concerned you're spending
a lot of time with this sickly child.

271
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:55,775
Remember, you're supposed
to be writing about me.

272
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,444
Sure, but isn't this why we're here?
To help these people?

273
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,405
I'm here to help these people.

274
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:03,992
You're here to help me help them
by writing a book about me

to my foundation.

We're in. It's too late to turn back now.

One of us isn't going
to come out of this alive.

281
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,054
Why do you all keep saying that?

282
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,391
Why can't we all assume we're gonna
make it out alive and go from there?

283

Alan, we've all got enough problems
without worrying about your imminent death.

Can't we just all shut up and do this?

a big, complicated mess?

[Bojack shouts]

298
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,028
Remember when my character
on Mr. Peanutbutter's house was

299
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:25,239
- elected president?
- Let me guess, it was all a dream?

300
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,450
No, I served half a term,
then resigned

301
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,827
because when Zachary
had a bad time with peer pressure,

302
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,154
I realized I was spending
too much time being president

303
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,623
and not enough time being a dad.

304
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:35,583

- Breaking and entering?

That is against everything
Nixon stood for.

We didn't mean to cause trouble.
We're trying to make a movie about Nixon.

Yeah? What, another leftist screed
about how corrupt he was?

312
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,329
- Uh...
- Or is it about how he had

313
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:56,353
an illegitimate son,

314
00:14:56,479 --> 00:15:00,024
and the son never knew who his dad was,
but always had a hunch it was Nixon,

315
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:03,694
and then that son grew up to be
the security guard at the Nixon library?

have an actor here to play Nixon?

Party's over.
That's something we say at crossfit.

331
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,443
Ugh. Wait a sec... I know you!

332
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,070
You were in justified.
You were amazing.

333
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,321
Okay, you caught me.

334
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:50,158
I am kind of
a well-known character actress.

335
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:53,161
I am such a huge fan, miss, uh...

336
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,412
What...? What's your name?

337
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,247
Sure, of course.

338
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,916
Everyone loves my work,
but apparently not enough

339
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,210
to watch the credits
and find out what my name is.

340
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,505
The important thing is that we enjoy
your great performances, right?

341
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,550
- How about you enjoy this? Aah!
- [Both] Whoa, whoa, whoa.

342
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:10,178
Margo, I thought we agreed, no guns.

343
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,389
Oh, is that what we agreed to?
I thought we said "no gum."

344
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,433
But you're also chewing gum.

345
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,602
I'm a wild card.

346
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,229
- Aah!
- Return fire!

347
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,647
Watch out!

348
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,275
Oh, no! Alan's dead!

349
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:27,028
No, I'm fine.
The bullet hit my cell phone.

350
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:30,198
Oh, no! Alan's cell phone is dead!

351
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,367
Nope, phone's fine, too.
Oh, hey, I got a text from my wife.

352
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,287
She's going into labor.
Guys, I'm gonna be a dad!

353
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:37,663
See you later!

354
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,582
[Police sirens wailing then guns cocking]

355
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,379
Die, you chunky assholes!

356
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,632
See, Jeff?
This is what I'm talking about.

357
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,050
[All shouting]

358
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,676
Shoofl

359
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:05,274
- How could this be any more perfect?
- Yoo-hoo.

360
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,652
Vanessa gekko.
How did you get in this painting?

361
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,278
I'm your servant, of course.

362
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,114
In your infinite generosity,
you gave me this job

363
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,617
when it became clear
that I don't have what it takes

364
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,619
to be a "hollywoo" power-agent.

365
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,204
Also, my husband left me.

366
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,666
And my children married each other
in an unholy incestuous union.

367
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,418
Plus, I have, like, colitis or something.

368
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,129
How appropriate!
Fetch me drink, wench.

369
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,131
- Right away, ma'am.
- Ah.

370
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,716
Diane...

371
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,804
[Diane] The second thing you notice
about Sebastian St. Clair

372
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,014
is how much he talks about himself.

373
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,516
This way is the library I built.

374
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:41,227
And over there is the statue
of me building the library.

375
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,480
And on that wall is a painting
of me posing for the statue.

376
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:47,733
Oh. Put a chapter in your book about that.

377
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,529
[Diane] The only respite
from his constant bombast is sleep,

378
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,072
and even then, sometimes...

379
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,490
[Bomb whistling then explodes]

380
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,409
[Diane gasps then people scream nearby]

381
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,122
Everybody...
Those of you who can walk, I mean.

382
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:04,500
Let's drag these corpses
to the mass grave behind the playground.

383
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,420
We need to make room
for my new hospital.

384
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,590
- Where's kinko? Is he okay?
- Oh, no, no, he's certainly dead.

385
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,092
See, Diane,
I told you not to make friends.

386
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,469
Jesus, you don't care
about any of these people.

387
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,723
You're just using them as props
for your big-shot superhero act.

388
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,475
Diane, the dead will not benefit
from our grief,

389
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:26,230
but the survivors need a new hospital
and we need to build it.

390
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:27,398
This is too much.

391
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:29,645
If you're going to survive,
you'll need to harden up.

392
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:32,445
I asked you to join me
because I thought you could handle it.

393
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,822
- But if you can't, you can go home.
- I...

394
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,866
I can handle it.

395
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,244
Great! Let's drag some bodies!
Kinko! Oh, never mind.

396
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,874
Hey, um, how come Nixon gets a line
and I don't get a line?

397
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,269
We only gave him a line
so he wouldn't call the police.

398
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:51,547
- If I call the police, will I get a line?
- No, we won't use it in the movie.

399
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,299
We only need the one-shot of me.

400
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,801
I just think if he gets a line,
I should get a line.

401
00:18:55,968 --> 00:19:00,097
- Ugh. Actors.
- Okay, positions everyone. And... action.

402
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,264
[As Nixon] I'm Nixon.

403
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,893
The way you're feeling
about your dead brother is how I feel

404
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,228
about the son I'll never know.

405
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:11,609
But I look at the moon and so does he,
and that's how I know we're connected.

406
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,194
And I'm checkers.

407
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:14,654
[Kelsey] All right, so, bojack,

408
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,198
you've been told
that your brother, jeffretariat,

409
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:20,701
the one Nixon sent to Vietnam
in your place, is dead.

410
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,745
You're feeling the weight of that guilt.

411
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:25,331
And the tears start to flow.

412
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,583
And the tears start to flow.

413
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,919
Oh. I don't cry in front of other people.

414
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,339
Well, you need to.
This is the emotional climax of the movie.

415
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:36,717
Yeah, okay, but I don't cry in front
of other people. I can't.

416
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,177
Really, never? Come on.

417
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,504
What if someone tells you
they'll take you to the park,

418
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:43,140
and they keep talking about the park
and all the fun you'll have,

419
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,308
but then...

420
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:47,478
But then they don't take you to the park.
I need a second.

421
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:51,524
Well, I'm sorry, I can't do it.
I didn't know you wanted me to cry.

422
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,526
Can you give us the room, please?

423
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,196
There's a park right outside
we can hang out at.

424
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,782
- Oh!
- Oh, we can't, the sprinklers are on.

425
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:07,957
Well, another beautiful, serene day
in magical fantasy-painting world.

426
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,500
[Sighs]

427
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,586
Queen Princess Carolyn, if I may,
I have some exciting news.

428
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,338
I just landed a new client.

429
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:15,673
- The mill owner!
- Huh?

430
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,342
We're doing a three-picture deal
about his waterwheel.

431
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,386
- Wait, you're making deals here?
- I'll say.

432
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:24,348
I'm now the biggest agent
in the entire idyllic new england village.

433
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:27,560
It's like you don't even read
the idyllic new england village trades.

434
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:28,769
What? No!

435
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:32,523
You're polluting my perfect serene
dream life. Why is this happening?

436
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,191
I don't know. It's your fantasy.

437
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,027
But if you ask me, I don't think
you want perfect and serene

438
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:39,405
and enough time to catch up
on the good wife.

439
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,323
Stop kidding yourself,
Princess Carolyn.

440
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:45,327
If you really wanted the simple life,
you'd have a simple life.

441
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,663
Oh, my god. I gotta get out of here.

442
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,832
Bye!

443
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,586
Hey. Yeah, I got rid of her.
Now this place is all mine.

444
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,421
Get your demo guys together.

445
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:59,258
Let's tear this old tudor down
and put up some condos! [Chuckles]

446
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,385
Okay.

447
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,262
[Margo laughing]

448
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,681
This isn't just for me.

449
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:08,726
It's for John carroll lynch
and cch pounder.

450
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:13,397
And all the other character actors
who live in lucrative obscurity.

451
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:15,900
The blood I spill today is for us all!

452
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:20,070
I'm character actress margo martindale!
[Chuckles]

453
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:24,784
Yeah, I'm going to go
with Princess Carolyn.

454
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,911
[Laughing and grunting]

455
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,330
Hmm.

456
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,873
[Cell phone ringing]

457
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,792
- Heho?
- Hey.

458
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,503
There you are!
I've been trying to call you all week.

459
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,922
- Yeah, the coverage in cordovia is...
- Diane, Diane.

460
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,632
Listen, I gotta tell you:

461
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,468
I'm sorry I gave you such
a hard time about your trip.

462
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,805
The truth is,
I really am so proud of you.

463
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,473
A lot of people talk big,

464
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,767
but you're actually out there
helping people.

465
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,310
You're the real deal, Diane.

466
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,771
- Yeah...
- How is it there? Is it amazing?

467
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,981
It's... good.

468
00:21:56,649 --> 00:22:00,069
It's hard, but it's good.

469
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,319
I miss you.

470
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,405
I miss you, too, but I promise,

471
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,866
these six months are gonna fly by.

472
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,661
Yeah. How's the game show going?

473
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:12,581
Oh, shit, I completely forgot I'm supposed
to be hosting a game show right now.

474
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,000
[Upbeat dance music playing]

475
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:19,797
[Caws]

476
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:21,507
I gotta go.

477
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,592
[Diane] And that's when you realize

478
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,345
that the book you've been writing
in your head

479
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:30,683
is never actually going to be a book,
so you stop...

480
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,604
I know what you're gonna say.

481
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:38,983
I'm a dumb sitcom actor
who's in over his head.

482
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,735
I'm sorry that I thought I could do this.

483
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,779
And I'm sorry I made you come here.

484
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,490
I'm sorry for everything.
I don't know what I'm doing.

485
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:48,117
Bojack, sit down.

486

[Grunts]

487
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:53,789
You've just been told your brother is dead
and that it's your fault.

488
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,583
But this moment is bigger than that.

489
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,878
This is the moment
that secretariat stops running.

490
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,547
Because this is the moment you realize

491
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:07,094
something inside you is broken,
and it can never be fixed.

492
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:10,847
We got it.

493
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:12,391
Really? I didn't cry.

494
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,935
You didn't have to.
Turteltaub's gonna love this.

- Oh. All right.
- Thanks for talking me into this.

496
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:23,360
Just so you know, I'm really glad
we're making this movie together.

497
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:27,197
- Didn't know I had it in me, did you?
- No, I knew.

498
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,824
Huh.

499
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,792
[Crying]

500
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,886
- Hold the elevator, please.
- Coming in?

501
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,472
- I'm all in.
- Whoa!

502
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,604
Mommy, it's nearly Christmas.
Where's uncle secretariat?

503
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:01,732
He had to go win a race
against the Russians.

504
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:04,777
But maybe, if he runs really fast...

505
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:07,071
- Hey, where's Kelsey?
- Oh, yeah, funny story.

506
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,573
Turns out you two knuckleheads
snuck out last night

507
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,992
and got that shot
I told you not to get for the scene

508
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,953
- that's not in the movie anymore.
- Uh...

509
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,830
Silly me, I didn't like that.
So I fired her ass.

510
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,749
- What?
- We got a movie to finish, okay?

511
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,042
So, go get in costume,

512
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,503
get your butt up that chimney,
and do your thing, Hamlet.

513
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:27,549
Just maybe,
all we have to do is believe!

514
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:28,759
[Slurping]

515
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,185
What are you doing here?

516
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:42,231
Hey, is it cool if I crash here
for a couple nights?

517
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,150
I didn't know where else to go.

518
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,654
Back in the '90s

519
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:53,951
I was in a very famous TV show

520
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:57,997
-I'm bojack the horse -bojack!

521
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:02,751
Bojack the horse
don't act like you don't know

522
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:09,466
and I'm trying to hold onto my past

523
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:14,179
it's been so long
I don't think I'm gonna last

524
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,850
I guess I was trying
to make you understand

525
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:22,062
that I'm more horse than a man

526
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:26,483
or I'm more man than a horse

527
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,193
bojack!
