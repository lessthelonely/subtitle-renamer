1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,095
Sir, you can't send me to Vietnam.

2
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,972
I can do whatever I want.

3
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:17,601
I'm president of the goddamn
United States of America.

4
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:19,311
Isn't that right, checkers?

5
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:21,647
That's what it says
on your business cards.

6
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:25,567
There are going to be riots
in the streets.

7
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,110
I'm secretariat.

8
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,279
You think I'm afraid
of a few rioting hippies?

9
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:32,199
Don't make me laugh. Ha-hoo.

10
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,284
Or whatever a laugh sounds like.

11
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,119
Please, I'll do anything.

12
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,247
You gotta send someone else
in my place.

13
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:44,294
Hmm. Perhaps an arrangement can be...
Arranged.

14
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:51,176
I'm just an athlete. I'm no hero.
My brother jeffretariat is the hero.

15
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:53,262
He's fighting the reds over in 'nam,

16
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:56,265
which is necessary
to protect our way of life.

17
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:59,434
And another hero is president Nixon.

18
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:03,063
He is one groovy dude.

19
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,400
Groovy.

20
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,072
What the hell are you doing?

21
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,239
Sorry, mommy!

22
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:14,658
Don't you dare put that out.

23
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:18,704
That is a perfectly good cigarette,
and you are going to finish it.

24
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,038
But I don't wanna.

25
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,291
And I don't want to be
the mother of a quitter.

26
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,042
Finish it.

27
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,713
Jesus Christ, you can't even smoke
a cigarette right.

28
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:31,216
Don't you dare cry,
don't you ever cry.

29
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:32,383
You wanted this.

30
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,721
Are you punishing me for smoking
or for stealing?

31
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,390
I'm punishing you for being alive.

32
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:48,317
Uh, bojack? You really shouldn't throw
a lit cigarette off the...

33
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,903
Fine. I'll call 911.

34
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,545
The fire department got
everything under control,

35
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,506
but the cable's out
for the neighborhood.

36
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,633
I don't understand
what started the fire.

37
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,653
Nobody knows where fires come from,
it's a mystery.

38
00:02:56,677 --> 00:03:00,347
Anyway, I am fired up
about my first day back on set.

39
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,307
We're gonna finish
that big Nixon scene.

40
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,810
We were just one shot away
before we went on hiatus.

41
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,937
Yeah, I know.
You told me at breakfast.

42
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,229
Why did you call me?

43
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,035
Usually I talk to Diane
on the way to work,

44
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,859
but she abandoned me to teach piano
in cordovia or something.

45
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,530
Oh. Well, glad you settled for me
because Diane wasn't available.

46
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:19,491
You bet. Oh, man, I'm gonna kill
in this Nixon scene.

47
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:22,244
Bojack gonna be in "da" house.

48
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:23,829
In da white house.

49
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,708
What happened to da house set?
Da white house set?

50
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,252
- Things changed a little.
- You cut the Nixon scene?

51
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,462
The Nixon scene is the core
of the whole movie.

52
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,881
Where we see secretariat
be morally corrupted

53
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,384
and get to look
into the real darkness of his soul.

54
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,678
It's still all that,
except now it happens

55
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,765
while you give a Christmas present
to your nieces

56
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,224
and they hug you
while your butt is stuck in a chimney.

57
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,851
Is one of the nieces Nixon?

58
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,686
Over hiatus, we ran a focus group.

59
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:50,230
People don't want
all that controversial stuff.

60
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:53,358
But we were supposed to make
a gritty movie about the real secretariat.

61
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,861
- Warts and all.
- Kid, "warts and all" don't pay bubkes.

62
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,488
That's why they took the gay stuff
out of a beautiful mind.

63
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,615
And that guy who spent 12 years
as a slave?

64
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,577
They don't talk about the 60 years
he spent as a jerk.

65
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,454
- Kelsey, you're okay with this?
- Ah.

66
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,620
That's showbiz.

67
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:09,207
See, bojack,
that's the shrug of a pro who gets it.

68
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,834
Good shrugging, kid.

69
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:15,338
Care-to-the-o-to-the-iyn-to-the...

70
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,265
That's the end of your name.
We need to talk.

71
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,593
We'll meet in the supply closet
in one minute. Break!

72
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,470
Oh, okay.

73
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:22,636
Ooh, ow.

74
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:26,558
Carolyn, when you're in the throes
of a very ugly divorce such as I am,

75
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:30,645
along with all that pain and degradation
comes a certain perfect clarity,

76
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:35,817
and right now that clarity is telling me
that you and I should get out of here.

77
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,403
Well, what do you mean,
"get out of here"?

78
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:42,866
Beautiful, I'm starting my own agency,
and I want you to be my partner in crime.

79
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,076
What? But I can't just leave vigor.

80
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:46,661
I've been here 20 years.

81
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,330
Who's gonna water the plants?

82
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:49,937
Um, I'm sorry. You water the plants?

83
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,583
I started doing it as an intern,

84
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,503
but then no one told me to stop,
so it's still kind of my job.

85
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,255
Carolyn,
you are my gritty, witty city kitty.

86
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,299
I want you with me, fifty-fifty.

87
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,635
Things are so crazy
for me right now. I...

88
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:05,430
Don't give me that, you want crazy.
"Crazy" is your favorite patsy cline song

89
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,557
and your second favorite
gnarls barkley song.

90
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:08,724
I don't want crazy.

91
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:12,354
I've got five episodes
of the good wife piled up on my dvr,

92
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,773
and I just want a night off
to enjoy them.

93
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,693
Well, if that's how you feel, I guess
I could just go to Vanessa gekko.

94
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,280
- Gekko?!
- But I'd rather look at you all day.

95
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:26,117
You're an amazing agent.
And you're bright, and you're fun.

96
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:29,746
And I think we could make something
really special.

97
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:32,958
We weren't doing anything!
We were just looking for closet supplies.

98
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:36,545
Are you the person to talk to
about unclogging the toilet?

99
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:37,963
Stuart, I'm your boss.

100
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:41,341
Okay, but you're the one
in the janitor's closet, so...

101
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,552
What, I'm the idiot?

102
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,766
The first thing you notice
about Sebastian St. Clair

103
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,476
is that he speaks in paragraphs.

104
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,937
Even I can't believe
how much good we've done here,

105
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,647
and I'll believe almost anything.

106
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:58,650
In the last six weeks,
we dug a new well, built a school,

107
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:01,653
and next month
the community center is doing seussical.

108
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,820
There we go.

109
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,739
In his previous life,
Sebastian owned

110
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,491
a chain of high-end department stores.

111
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:08,159
I want to stock up on muffs.

112
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,705
We're going to sell a lot of muffs
this winter. Huzzah!

113
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,833
Diane, I lived a life
of power and luxury,

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,793
and then my picture
was in the newspaper.

115
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,628
- A real-life newspaper!
- Uh-huh.

116
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,547
But I knew my life was empty.

117
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,550
At night I heard the cries
of children sick and dying.

118
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,385
And I would scream into the night.

119
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,846
Shut up! Shut up, children!

120
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:30,807
But the phantom cries would not abate.

121
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,601
And so I began my travels,

122
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,048
with little more than a compass,
a yearning for adventure,

123
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,980
and several crates full of unsold muffs.

124
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:40,483
I knew there were people out there
just waiting for my help.

125
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,527
Diane, this is kinko.

126
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:43,694
I am kinko.

127
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,988
In his language, it means,

128
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:47,782
orphan whose parents were murdered
by rebels and will die young,

129
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,409
probably from malaria.

130
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:50,952
Hi, kinko. I'm Diane.

131
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,747
It means,
my parents liked the show cheers.

132
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:58,043
Cheers! Oh, you're good.
You're very good.

133
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,169
When Sebastian St. Clair says
you're good,

134
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,963
you want to believe
that you really are.

135
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,675
That you, like Sebastian, are part
of something bigger than just yourself.

136
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:09,012
And for a moment,
you feel like you are.

137
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,931
Kinko made a mess.

138
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:17,520
Now I finally realize that a triple hug is
way more valuable than a triple crown.

139
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,606
And cut. Neat.

140
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,775
- Let's break for lunch.
- Oh!

141
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,028
Kelsey, this is a nightmare.

142
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:28,073
I had to touch three children today,
and one of them was sticky.

143
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,533
Yeah, it was you.
Wash your damn hands, you gremlin.

144
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,411
- Bojack, there's nothing we can do.
- No, this isn't you.

145
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,913
I've seen everything you've done.

146
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,582
Your films are challenging and gritty,
and they're great.

147
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,019
I'm not just saying that
because they're full of lesbians.

148
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,504
Look, even if I wanted to finish
that Nixon scene,

149
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,589
we don't have an oval office set.

150
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,636
There's one at the Nixon library
in yorba Linda.

151
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,551
Why on earth do you know that?

152
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,988
In season three of horsin'around,
the horse got elected president

153
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,180
and we shot on location.

154
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,100
We can sneak into the library
and get the shot, guerilla-style.

155
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,786
Once turteltaub sees it,
he'll love it,

156
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:59,437
and we can make the movie
we both want to make.

157
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:03,775
- Okay, I'm in. Let's do it.
- All right!

158
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,111
Did they really make
your character president?

159
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,277
Only for season three.

160
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,698
In season four, it turned out
it was all a dream.

161
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,908
They called my airplane air horse one.

162
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,703
And the vice president was
a hip-hop zebra named zebro.

163
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,538
- Come on.
- It wasn't our best season.

164
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:18,915
But on the bright side,
it was not our worst.

165
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,752
Step one, we go to the Nixon library

166
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,796
and steal the scale model.

167
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,923
Welcome to my library.

168
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,175
I'm Nixon..

169
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,887
Yeah, you know,
some people say I look like Nixon.

170
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:36,725
Not because he's my dad or anything.
That's crazy. Nixon's not my dad.

171
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:40,228
But if you have any questions about Nixon,
I'd be happy to answer them.

172
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,939
Yeah, I have a question. Um...

173
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:46,651
Is that the lighted exit sign
from Nixon's boyhood home?

174
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,487
Uh, no, that's just an exit sign.

175
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,822
- Is that...
- Here we go.

176
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,950
The handicapped drinking fountain
he used in the white house?

177
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,785
No, just a normal drinking fountain.

178
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:56,952
- Hang on.
- One more.

179
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,289
- Is that the smoke alarm...?
- No.

180
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,086
So the oval office is right here,
next to the men's room.

181
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,315
I remember because season three of
horsin'around was a big cocaine year for me.

182
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,008
All the pressures of being president.

183
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:13,553
- I don't see how we can pull this off.
- We're gonna need a crack team.

184
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,514
First, we gotta get
the best lock-pick in the city.

185
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,017
- Not interested.
- Okay.

186
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,894
The second best lock-pick in the city.

187
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,937
- No way I'm doing that.
- Got it.

188
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,104
A lock-pick.

189
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,565
Todd, can you pick locks?

190
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,650
- Kind of.
- Great. You're in.

191
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,177
We 'ii need an expert cat burglar.

192
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,571
All right, good wife,
let's see what you got.

193
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,073
Hey, Princess Carolyn!

194
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,909
Kelsey and I are gonna break
into the Nixon library

195
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,661
to steal a shot
for our secretariat movie.

196
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:43,625
It's a super-sneaky, kooky caper
that stands to benefit you in no way.

197
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:44,792
Are you in?

198
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,628
Hey! Shut up down there!

199
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:48,230
- You shut up!
- Make me!

200
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,673
Hey, you got a problem?
Take it up with my agent,

201
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,759
your downstairs neighbor
Princess Carolyn.

202
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,304
We 'ii need someone to play checkers.

203
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,015
Hey, Chicago! Al Capone, deep dish.

204
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:02,602
What does Ethan hawke know?
We'll find out tonight. Da bears.

205
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,229
Bojack, I'd love to help you out,

206
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,147
but I'm super-busy recording promos

207
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,358
for television's
highest-rated new game show.

208
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,694
- We can probably do it without you.
- This next one's for Seattle.

209
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,823
Hey, Seattle! Space needle, Starbucks.

210
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:18,243
What does Ethan hawke know?
We'll find out tonight. Rain.

211
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:21,746
It's too bad though because I could
really bring a lot to this project.

212
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,958
The more I think about it,
checkers wouldn't even be in the shot.

213
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,668
It's just a single on secretariat.

214
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:30,630
Hey, waco, Texas! Terrible tragedy.
What does Ethan hawke know?

215
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,967
- We'll find out tonight. So sorry.
- You know what? Forget I even asked.

216
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,761
- Twist my arm, why don't you? I'll do it.
- Okay.

217
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,365
Finally, we 'ii need a criminal mastermind.

218
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,725
Character actress margo martindale,
you've been a model prisoner.

219
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,394
I'm glad I served my time.

220
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,437
But now I'm ready to move on with my life

221
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,273
and get back to doing small roles

222
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:51,025
in critically-acclaimed films
and television shows.

223
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,904
Watch, purse, lipstick,

224
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,782
Emmy award
for best guest actress.

225
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,039
I need your help with a break-in.

226
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:08,042
Bojack, I've been out of prison
for two minutes.

227
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,919
What took you so long?

228
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:16,426
Kelsey, Mr. Peanutbutter and I
are gonna break into the library.

229
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:19,637
But the problem is,
the place is crawling with cops.

230
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:20,972
They're on high alert

231
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:24,184
because some idiot
stole this model last night.

232
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,644
Yeah, nice work, Todd.

233
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:30,815
Who am I kidding?
I can't stay mad. You're adorable.

234
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:34,736
Look at your big saucer eyes.
I can go swimming in them!

235
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,155
- Totally.
- Now, we need to lose the cops.

236
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,115
The rest of you will create a diversion

237
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:43,161
by breaking into the only other place
in yorba Linda of cultural significance:

238
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,747
The discount fine art gallery
in the strip mall,

239
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,082
between the tanning salon
and the adult bookstore.

240
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,752
Once you set off the alarm,
all the cops will go there.

241
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:57,342
Now, things could get ugly.
One of you is very likely to die.

242
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:00,220
- Possibly Alan.
- Why possibly Alan?

243
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,430
You are the guy
none of us knows that well.

244
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,265
I just came to fix your cable.

245
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:07,685
You already know too much.
You're a part of this now, like it or not.

246
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,146
- But...
- Hey, you think you could keep it down?

247
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:13,107
I'm reading a script
and I'm having trouble focusing,

248
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,360
so now my notes are
gonna be confusing and vague.

249
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:16,319
We're almost done.

250
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,326
I know you're having fun
with your police cars,

251
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,783
I just wish you would have asked
before you invited these people over.

252
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,035
- I live here, too.
- You're right. I'm sorry.

253
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:26,913
And can you at least let Alan
fix the cable before he dies?

254
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,416
I can't die. I'm endangered!

255
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,045
"And the truffle-infused gnocchi
was the star dish

256
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:37,131
at this up-and-comer that will please
the pickiest of brooklynites

257
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,938
and the less discerning staten islander."

258
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,803
When I grow up, I can be food critic
for new yorker?

259
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,888
You can do anything you want in life.

260
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:47,475
I mean, ot everyone can write for the new
yorker, but there's always the Atlantic.

261
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,018
Diane,

262
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,563
I'm concerned you're spending
a lot of time with this sickly child.

263
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:55,775
Remember, you're supposed
to be writing about me.

264
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,444
Sure, but isn't this why we're here?
To help these people?

265
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,405
I'm here to help these people.

266
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:03,992
You're here to help me help them
by writing a book about me

267
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:07,161
so people back home will give money
to my foundation.

268
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,413
Great.

269
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:14,127
Okay, come on. Over here. Get it.

270
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,299
We're in. It's too late to turn back now.

271
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:23,219
One of us isn't going
to come out of this alive.

272
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,054
Why do you all keep saying that?

273
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,391
Why can't we all assume we're gonna
make it out alive and go from there?

274
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:31,978
Alan, we've all got enough problems
without worrying about your imminent death.

275
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,938
Can't we just all shut up and do this?

276
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:37,275
Why does everything have to be
a big, complicated mess?

277
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,360
Like,
look at this Thomas kinkade painting.

278
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,945
It's simple.

279
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:44,449
And serene. And pleasant.

280
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,163
I think that the vest
makes me look kind of chunky.

281
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,458
I don't do crossfit five days a week
to not look sweet in this uniform.

282
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,419
I swear to god,
if you don't shut up about crossfit...

283
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,379
Break-in at the discount

284
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,089
fine art gallery at the strip mall.

285
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,843
Let's roll!
That's a thing we say at crossfit.

286
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,028
Remember when my character
on Mr. Peanutbutter's house was

287
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:25,239
- elected president?
- Let me guess, it was all a dream?

288
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,450
No, I served half a term,
then resigned

289
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,827
because when Zachary
had a bad time with peer pressure,

290
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,154
I realized I was spending
too much time being president

291
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,623
and not enough time being a dad.

292
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:35,583
It's like you didn't even watch my show.

293
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,336
Okay, I'd like you here.

294
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,546
And then you are going to be over here.

295
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,507
- Freeze!
- I'm union.

296
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,467
- Playing dead.
- Breaking and entering?

297
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:47,053
That is against everything
Nixon stood for.

298
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,223
We didn't mean to cause trouble.
We're trying to make a movie about Nixon.

299
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,893
Yeah? What, another leftist screed
about how corrupt he was?

300
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,329
- Uh...
- Or is it about how he had

301
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:56,353
an illegitimate son,

302
00:14:56,479 --> 00:15:00,024
and the son never knew who his dad was,
but always had a hunch it was Nixon,

303
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:03,694
and then that son grew up to be
the security guard at the Nixon library?

304
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,320
The second one?

305
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:09,075
Well, if that's true, how come you don't
have an actor here to play Nixon?

306
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,701
Because...

307
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:15,081
We couldn't find anyone who could
appropriately capture his magic.

308
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,125
You know, I do a pretty good Nixon.

309
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,127
You? No way.

310
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,545
Hello, I'm Nixon.

311
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:24,924
I can't be at your soccer game, but I am
your father and I love you very much.

312
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,384
Oh, my god. He's perfect.

313
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,010
We've found our Nixon.

314
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,054
I can be ready in five.

315
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:31,431
Uh. Did we get the shot?

316
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,685
It's so peaceful.

317
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,354
- Okay, folks.
- Aah!

318
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:41,065
Party's over.
That's something we say at crossfit.

319
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,443
Ugh. Wait a sec... I know you!

320
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,070
You were in justified.
You were amazing.

321
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,321
Okay, you caught me.

322
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:50,158
I am kind of
a well-known character actress.

323
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:53,161
I am such a huge fan, miss, uh...

324
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,412
What...? What's your name?

325
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,247
Sure, of course.

326
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,916
Everyone loves my work,
but apparently not enough

327
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,210
to watch the credits
and find out what my name is.

328
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,505
The important thing is that we enjoy
your great performances, right?

329
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,550
- How about you enjoy this? Aah!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

330
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:10,178
Margo, I thought we agreed, no guns.

331
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,389
Oh, is that what we agreed to?
I thought we said "no gum."

332
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,433
But you're also chewing gum.

333
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,602
I'm a wild card.

334
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,229
- Aah!
- Return fire!

335
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,647
Watch out!

336
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,275
Oh, no! Alan's dead!

337
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:27,028
No, I'm fine.
The bullet hit my cell phone.

338
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:30,198
Oh, no! Alan's cell phone is dead!

339
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,367
Nope, phone's fine, too.
Oh, hey, I got a text from my wife.

340
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,287
She's going into labor.
Guys, I'm gonna be a dad!

341
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:37,663
See you later!

342
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,379
Die, you chunky assholes!

343
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,632
See, Jeff?
This is what I'm talking about.

344
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,676
Shoofl

345
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:05,274
- How could this be any more perfect?
- Yoo-hoo.

346
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,652
Vanessa gekko.
How did you get in this painting?

347
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,278
I'm your servant, of course.

348
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,114
In your infinite generosity,
you gave me this job

349
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,617
when it became clear
that I don't have what it takes

350
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,619
to be a "hollywoo" power-agent.

351
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,204
Also, my husband left me.

352
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,666
And my children married each other
in an unholy incestuous union.

353
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,418
Plus, I have, like, colitis or something.

354
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,129
How appropriate!
Fetch me drink, wench.

355
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,131
- Right away, ma'am.
- Ah.

356
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,716
Diane...

357
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,804
The second thing you notice
about Sebastian St. Clair

358
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,014
is how much he talks about himself.

359
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,516
This way is the library I built.

360
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:41,227
And over there is the statue
of me building the library.

361
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,480
And on that wall is a painting
of me posing for the statue.

362
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:47,733
Oh. Put a chapter in your book about that.

363
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,529
The only respite
from his constant bombast is sleep,

364
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,072
and even then, sometimes...

365
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,122
Everybody...
Those of you who can walk, I mean.

366
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:04,500
Let's drag these corpses
to the mass grave behind the playground.

367
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,420
We need to make room
for my new hospital.

368
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,590
- Where's kinko? Is he okay?
- Oh, no, no, he's certainly dead.

369
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,092
See, Diane,
I told you not to make friends.

370
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,469
Jesus, you don't care
about any of these people.

371
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,723
You're just using them as props
for your big-shot superhero act.

372
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,475
Diane, the dead will not benefit
from our grief,

373
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:26,230
but the survivors need a new hospital
and we need to build it.

374
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:27,398
This is too much.

375
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:29,645
If you're going to survive,
you'll need to harden up.

376
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:32,445
I asked you to join me
because I thought you could handle it.

377
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,822
- But if you can't, you can go home.
- I...

378
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,866
I can handle it.

379
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,244
Great! Let's drag some bodies!
Kinko! Oh, never mind.

380
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,874
Hey, um, how come Nixon gets a line
and I don't get a line?

381
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,269
We only gave him a line
so he wouldn't call the police.

382
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:51,547
- If I call the police, will I get a line?
- No, we won't use it in the movie.

383
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,299
We only need the one-shot of me.

384
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,801
I just think if he gets a line,
I should get a line.

385
00:18:55,968 --> 00:19:00,097
- Ugh. Actors.
- Okay, positions everyone. And... action.

386
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,264
I'm Nixon.

387
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,893
The way you're feeling
about your dead brother is how I feel

388
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,228
about the son I'll never know.

389
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:11,609
But I look at the moon and so does he,
and that's how I know we're connected.

390
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,194
And I'm checkers.

391
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:14,654
All right, so, bojack,

392
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,198
you've been told
that your brother, jeffretariat,

393
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:20,701
the one Nixon sent to Vietnam
in your place, is dead.

394
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,745
You're feeling the weight of that guilt.

395
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:25,331
And the tears start to flow.

396
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,583
And the tears start to flow.

397
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,919
Oh. I don't cry in front of other people.

398
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,339
Well, you need to.
This is the emotional climax of the movie.

399
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:36,717
Yeah, okay, but I don't cry in front
of other people. I can't.

400
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,177
Really, never? Come on.

401
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,504
What if someone tells you
they'll take you to the park,

402
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:43,140
and they keep talking about the park
and all the fun you'll have,

403
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,308
but then...

404
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:47,478
But then they don't take you to the park.
I need a second.

405
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:51,524
Well, I'm sorry, I can't do it.
I didn't know you wanted me to cry.

406
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,526
Can you give us the room, please?

407
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,196
There's a park right outside
we can hang out at.

408
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,782
- Oh!
- Oh, we can't, the sprinklers are on.

409
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:07,957
Well, another beautiful, serene day
in magical fantasy-painting world.

410
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,586
Queen Princess Carolyn, if I may,
I have some exciting news.

411
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,338
I just landed a new client.

412
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:15,673
- The mill owner!
- Huh?

413
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,342
We're doing a three-picture deal
about his waterwheel.

414
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,386
- Wait, you're making deals here?
- I'll say.

415
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:24,348
I'm now the biggest agent
in the entire idyllic new england village.

416
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:27,560
It's like you don't even read
the idyllic new england village trades.

417
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:28,769
What? No!

418
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:32,523
You're polluting my perfect serene
dream life. Why is this happening?

419
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,191
I don't know. It's your fantasy.

420
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,027
But if you ask me, I don't think
you want perfect and serene

421
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:39,405
and enough time to catch up
on the good wife.

422
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,323
Stop kidding yourself,
Princess Carolyn.

423
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:45,327
If you really wanted the simple life,
you'd have a simple life.

424
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,663
Oh, my god. I gotta get out of here.

425
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,832
Bye!

426
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,586
Hey. Yeah, I got rid of her.
Now this place is all mine.

427
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,421
Get your demo guys together.

428
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:59,258
Let's tear this old tudor down
and put up some condos!

429
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,385
Okay.

430
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,681
This isn't just for me.

431
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:08,726
It's for John carroll lynch
and cch pounder.

432
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:13,397
And all the other character actors
who live in lucrative obscurity.

433
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:15,900
The blood I spill today is for us all!

434
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:20,070
I'm character actress margo martindale!

435
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:24,784
Yeah, I'm going to go
with Princess Carolyn.

436
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,330
Hmm.

437
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,792
- Heho?
- Hey.

438
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,503
There you are!
I've been trying to call you all week.

439
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,922
- Yeah, the coverage in cordovia is...
- Diane, Diane.

440
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,632
Listen, I gotta tell you:

441
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,468
I'm sorry I gave you such
a hard time about your trip.

442
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,805
The truth is,
I really am so proud of you.

443
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,473
A lot of people talk big,

444
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,767
but you're actually out there
helping people.

445
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,310
You're the real deal, Diane.

446
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,771
- Yeah...
- How is it there? Is it amazing?

447
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,981
It's... good.

448
00:21:56,649 --> 00:22:00,069
It's hard, but it's good.

449
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,319
I miss you.

450
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,405
I miss you, too, but I promise,

451
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,866
these six months are gonna fly by.

452
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,661
Yeah. How's the game show going?

453
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:12,581
Oh, shit, I completely forgot I'm supposed
to be hosting a game show right now.

454
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:21,507
I gotta go.

455
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,592
And that's when you realize

456
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,345
that the book you've been writing
in your head

457
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:30,683
is never actually going to be a book,
so you stop...

458
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,604
I know what you're gonna say.

459
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:38,983
I'm a dumb sitcom actor
who's in over his head.

460
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,735
I'm sorry that I thought I could do this.

461
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,779
And I'm sorry I made you come here.

462
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,490
I'm sorry for everything.
I don't know what I'm doing.

463
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:48,117
Bojack, sit down.

464
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:53,789
You've just been told your brother is dead
and that it's your fault.

465
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,583
But this moment is bigger than that.

466
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,878
This is the moment
that secretariat stops running.

467
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,547
Because this is the moment you realize

468
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:07,094
something inside you is broken,
and it can never be fixed.

469
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:10,847
We got it.

470
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:12,391
Really? I didn't cry.

471
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,935
You didn't have to.
Turteltaub's gonna love this.

472
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:18,689
- Oh. All right.
- Thanks for talking me into this.

473
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:23,360
Just so you know, I'm really glad
we're making this movie together.

474
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:27,197
- Didn't know I had it in me, did you?
- No, I knew.

475
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,824
Huh.

476
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,886
- Hold the elevator, please.
- Coming in?

477
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,472
- I'm all in.
- Whoa!

478
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,604
Mommy, it's nearly Christmas.
Where's uncle secretariat?

479
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:01,732
He had to go win a race
against the Russians.

480
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:04,777
But maybe, if he runs really fast...

481
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:07,071
- Hey, where's Kelsey?
- Oh, yeah, funny story.

482
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,573
Turns out you two knuckleheads
snuck out last night

483
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,992
and got that shot
I told you not to get for the scene

484
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,953
- that's not in the movie anymore.
- Uh...

485
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,830
Silly me, I didn't like that.
So I fired her ass.

486
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,749
- What?
- We got a movie to finish, okay?

487
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,042
So, go get in costume,

488
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,503
get your butt up that chimney,
and do your thing, Hamlet.

489
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:27,549
Just maybe,
all we have to do is believe!

490
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,185
What are you doing here?

491
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:42,231
Hey, is it cool if I crash here
for a couple nights?

492
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,150
I didn't know where else to go.

493
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,654
Back in the '90s

494
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:53,951
I was in a very famous TV show

495
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:57,997
-I'm bojack the horse -bojack!

496
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:02,751
Bojack the horse
don't act like you don't know

497
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:09,466
and I'm trying to hold onto my past

498
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:14,179
it's been so long
I don't think I'm gonna last

499
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,850
I guess I was trying
to make you understand

500
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:22,062
that I'm more horse than a man

501
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:26,483
or I'm more man than a horse

502
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,193
bojack!
