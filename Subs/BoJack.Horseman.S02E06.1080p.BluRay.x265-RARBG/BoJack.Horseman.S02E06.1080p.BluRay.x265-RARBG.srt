If Mr. Peanutbutter said,
"I love you. No, I don't,"

- Law, lo, leno, and j. Abrams.
- Oh, that's wonderful news

167
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:05,628
in the parallel universe
in which you were on time today.

168
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,548
In this reality, however, we're all good.

169
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,800
You can lap up the leftovers though.

170
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,595
- "Mr. Peanutbutter"?
- Oh, and Princess Carolyn?

171
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:14,846
Get your shoe fixed.

172
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,932
You look like a woman
from an '805 deodorant commercial.

[Inhales sharply]

174
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,193
Here I go.
Destiny, don't fail me now. [Grunts]

175
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,697
Yeah. Hitting the pavement.

176
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:35,116
This is how it happens for a guy like me.

177
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,708
[Grunts] Ew...

178
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,960
Out of my way, flyer.

179
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:50,840
Ugh. Flyer. Why do you have to be
on my shoe in front of this store?

180
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,343
Wait, a second. Shoe.

181
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,053
Store.

182
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,806
Shoe store? Shoe store.

183
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,557
"Team players wanted"?

184
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,601
Oh, I'm such a good team player,

185
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,687
I make all the other team players
look like garbage.

186
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:08,024
Lady footlocker, meet your lord.

187
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,698
Finish... [grunts]

188
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,160
Line.

189
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,163
Great, we got it. We got one take.

190
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,957
And now we gotta stop for the day.

191
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,208
What? No. Why stop now?

192
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:29,003
- I'm just getting warmed up.
- Union rules. We're done. Go home.

193
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,213
Go home?

194
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,175
Why go home when we could extend
this long day's journey into night?

195
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,928
- Drinks on me, folks.
- I could use a drink.

196
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,681
- Or six.
- Great, corduroy's driving. Let's go.

197
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,267
[Corduroy] Ah...

198
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,311
- I really needed this, bojack.
- Me, too.

199
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,689
Yeah, man.
This day's been really hard on me.

200
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:50,900
Ever since I heard about that agent
who died from that blue-face blastoff?

201
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,902
- Blue-face blastoff?
- The strokey chokey?

202
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,362
- The two-neck squeeze?
- What?

203
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,739
You know, the one hand
on the Adam's apple,

204
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,867
the other one's
on the Adam's banana?

205
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:02,078
Oh, right. Right. Yeah. The auto-erotic...

206
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:04,965
That could've been me, you know.
I used to really be into that stuff.

207
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,624
I was a hard-core gasper.

208
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,511
Can't believe you have
so many names for it.

209
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,086
Now I can't stop thinking about it.

210
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,297
I shouldn't even be alive right now.

211
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,191
Don't need to talk about
how you masturbate.

212
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,342
- The orgasms you get...
- Okay, I guess we do.

213
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,137
It's like seeing a rainbow,
but with all the colors.

214
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,890
- So, like a normal rainbow?
- But it's too dangerous, man.

215
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:25,059
They say if you bite down on a lemon
right at the point of climax,

216
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:28,688
the lemon juice gives you the jolt
you need to not pass out and die.

217
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:32,859
But still man,
you're just... rolling the dice.

218
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,986
Okay, this is getting really graphic.

219
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,821
Can we maybe
talk about anything else?

220
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,573
- Sure.
- Thank god.

221
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:43,119
Hey, man, it's funny you should mention
god, because my new thing is... the Bible.

222
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:48,625
Tell me, have you accepted Jesus Christ
as your lord and personal savior?

223
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,836
So, noose-wise, what are we talking?
You use a standard sailor's knot

224
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,880
or more like your average
birthday-present bow?

- I beeped you, bojack.
- Oh, hey. About this morning...

228
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,810
- It's fine.
- Because when I said that...

229
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,104
I said it's fine. You don't love me.

230
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,024
That's okay. I don't love you.

231
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:15,735
- What?
- Good night.

- And I'm some lady.

235
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,454
On today's show,
I sit down with Hank hippopopalous

236
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,958
to discuss his new smash hit,
hey, I think you can dance.

237
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,918
Can you talk about your process?

238
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,087
When I see someone,
and I think they can dance,

239
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,048
I say,
"hey, I think you can dance."

240
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:41,386
And when I think they can't dance,
I say, "no, I don't think you can dance."

241
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,222
- And that is pretty much it.
- Fascinating.

242
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,309
- So, last night when...
- Bojack, it's not a big deal.

243
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,228
You don't love me, I don't love you.

We're having a good time. It's fine.

Can't just say, "I don't love you"
to someone.

246
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,110
- You said it to me.
- Yeah, but that was different.

247
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,862
- How was that different?
- Because you do love me. Right?

248
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,447
- Like a little bit?
- No.

that he had a client so hush-hush,

hate reading so much,

and don't even pay a living wage.

And all those modern reading slaves
really wanna be doing

327
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:50,259
is writing things that, one day,
other people will also avoid reading.

- Come with me, j.D. Salinger.

329
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,681
Let's go to hollywoo.

330
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:07,652
Oh... [sighs]

331
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,111
- Hey.
- Hey.

332
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,780
- We need to talk.
- Okay.

333
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,033
You're probably wondering
what this beautiful mahogany box is.

334
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,411
- I wasn't wondering that.
- It's my auto-erotic asphyxiation kit.

335
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,956
I've decided to do the funky spider-man.

336
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,583
- What? Funky spider-man?
- I came up with that one myself.

337
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,544
Its because he hangs,
then he shoots webbing.

338
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,339
Wait. Are you saying you want to
auto-erotic asphyxiate yourself?

339
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:29,632
Yes. I do.

340
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,342
Even though it's very dangerous

341
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,094
- and I could die.
- Oh.

342
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:36,305
Now, if you love me, you probably
wouldn't want me to do it.

343
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,517
- Okay. I get it.
- Since you don't, I should do it, right?

344
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:42,520
I mean, there's no reason not to...
Unless you love me.

345
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,146
- Do it.
- Wait. Seriously?

346
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,033
Seems like you've already
made up your mind.

347
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,109
If you're that set on it,
knock yourself out.

348
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:50,736
[Laughs] Only if I do it wrong.

349
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,447
Because as I mentioned before,
it's very dangerous.

350
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,992
- Have fun.
- I'm serious. I'm really gonna do it.

351
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:59,328
Great. Put a towel down.
Not one of the good ones.

352
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,615
[Upbeat theme music playing]

353
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,540
[In unison]
Morning time, hollywoo.

354
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,417
I'm a Ryan seacrest type.

355
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:07,962
And I'm an actress or something,
I don't know, sitting in for some lady.

356
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:10,506
- Whoa. What happened to her?
- She got kidnapped.

357
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,174
Oh, boy.

358
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:15,469
[Laughs] Oh, my. Ooh, wow.

359
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,723
Oh, hey. Look who survived
to masturbate another day.

360
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,600
Well, I didn't do it yet, obviously.

361
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,518
If I'm gonna do it,
I'm gonna go all out.

362
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:25,605
A big job like that needs lumber,
and pulleys, lemons, so forth.

363
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:29,108
I'm not gonna half-ass anything.
This is my orgasm we're talking about.

364
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,360
Okay. Well, I wish you all the best.

365
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,654
- Not too late to stop me.
- I'm not gonna stop you.

366
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,073
- Good 'cause don't.
- All right, we're in agreement.

367
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,450
Stop fighting!

368
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,577
Can't you two see
what this is doing to me?

369
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:42,204
I've been acting out. [Grunts]

370
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,498
Have a great day.

371
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,250
Todd? Get in the car.

372
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:49,211
It's time to get serious
about auto-erotic asphyxiation.

373
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,548
Hooray! Question Mark?

374
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:59,430
Just play it cool, Todd.
No one needs to know why we're here.

375
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:02,767
Excuse me, I'm looking for something
that will hold up a lot of weight.

376
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:06,646
Let's say something that could hoist up
a horse comfortably by the neck.

377
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,273
Not for suicide purposes.

378
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,151
I'm trying to have
a more fulfilling orgasm.

379
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,741
The world wept when news broke
that j.D. Salinger died.

380
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,703
- '[Gasps] J.D. Salinger died?
- But I'm here to tell you, he didn't die.

381
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,580
[Gasps] J.D. Salinger didn't die?

382
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,625
As one of the 20th century's
most celebrated authors,

383
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,670
j.d. Salinger has inspired
countless dreamers,

384
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,089
eighth graders
and occasionally, assassins.

385
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:36,175
His spare lyricism
and devotion to character

386
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:40,012
will undoubtedly translate into
a penetrating dramatic work for this,

387
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,223
the golden age of television writing.

388
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,141
J.d. Take it away.

389
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:48,521
I wanna do a show where people
ask celebrities trivia questions.

390
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,189
- What?
- Like a game show?

391
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,525
Yeah. You know because
since they're famous people,

392
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:55,945
well I think normal people would wanna see
if they know trivia and stuff.

393
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:59,615
You know, like, hollywoo stars
and celebrities, what do they know?

394
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,951
Do they know things? Let's find out.

395
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:05,496
What a hoot. I love it, and I don't
use that word with just anybody.

396
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:06,497
What do you call it?

397
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:10,042
I call it hollywoo stars and
celebrities: What do they know?

398
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,253
Do they know things?
Let's find out.

399
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,088
It's maybe more of a working title.

400
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:16,006
I can see it on the marquee already.

401
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,675
- Must be a long marquee.
- It's long.

402
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:20,636
Yeah, yeah. The celebrities
can also do physical challenges.

403
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:21,554
Oh, it's perfect.

404
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,974
We've been searching for a companion
for hey, I think you can dance.

405
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,393
But wait, wait one second.
Who's gonna host?

406
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,396
Huh. I've got the perfect guy.

407
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,691
Who wants to be in Nike airs?

408
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,486
Claire, you are looking off the charts
"gorg" in those tennis shoes.

409
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:41,407
But let me ask you this:
Would you like to buy a towel?

410
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,201
Because I'm throwing one in for free.

411
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,203
- He's perfect.
- [Wanda] Mm-hm.

412
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,538
Mr. Peanutbutter?

413
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:52,626
How would you like to be the host of
j.D. Salinger's new celebrity game show?

414
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:56,088
What? I knew destiny had a plan for me.

415
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,007
You know, it just goes to show,

416
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:00,676
with the right attitude,
every single one of your dreams

417
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,344
will always come true.

418
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,138
And if your dreams don't come true,

419
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:08,058
it's probably because you just
didn't have the right attitude.

420
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:14,940
Today, one agent did something
that no one else could.

421
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,943
I'll give you two hints: Catcher and rye.

422
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,779
Oh. Nothing. It's nothing.

423
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:24,033
Charley Witherspoon caught a rye bagel
coming out of the toaster.

424
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,077
- Come again?
- It was coming fast and hot.

425
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:30,748
One day, some genius will invent
some sort of bagel catcher

426
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,750
that takes the guesswork out of this task,

427
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:36,128
but until then, Charley gets a gold star.

428
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:40,466
- Thanks, dad. I mean, Mr. Dad.
- Oh...

429
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,971
Oh, boy.

430
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,640
Hey. Wasn't sure if I'd see you.

431
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:51,310
Still alive? Because auto-erotic
asphyxiation is so risky?

432
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,103
Well, here I am, for now.

433
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,648
Bojack... wait.
Did you fix the bed?

434
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,399
Yeah. I was at the hardware store

435
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:00,778
picking up supplies for my auto-erotic
asphyxiation machine.

436
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,196
Because, as you are aware,

437
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:05,407
I'm preparing to auto-erotic
asphyxiate myself.

438
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:09,411
Figured I'd get stuff for the bed so you
could at least get a good night's sleep.

439
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,330
Okay, bojack.

440
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,374
Wanna talk about
the elephant in the room?

441
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,752
Wow. Okay. You know what?

442
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,421
You know what? Here's... first of all...

443
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:23,759
Wow. All right, I can't even... [groans]

444
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,512
You know what? [Scoffs]

445
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:27,513
Wow.

446
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,390
He is never gonna forget that.

447
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:30,599
What is this all about?

448
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,561
This isn't about anything but
the pursuit of the kind of orgasm

449
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,938
that feels like a rainbow
with every color.

450
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,523
- So, a regular rainbow.
- No.

451
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,442
So, if you don't mind,
as long as you don't love me,

452
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,987
I have a noose to step into.
[Clears throat]

453
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,947
I just need to release this lever,

454
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:47,366
drop these bags of sand,
which act as counterweights,

455
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,952
and then just pull this nozzle.

456
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,413
- Perfect.
- Okay. Have fun.

457
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:56,625
- Wait, Wanda. [Grunting and choking]
- Okay, fine, you stupid baby.

458
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,127
I love you.

459
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:01,422
I... [coughs] I knew it.

460
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:05,009
But I'm not going to tell you
not to do the funky spider-man.

461
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:08,053
- [Coughs] What?
- You need to be responsible for yourself.

462
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,972
- That doesn't sound like me.
- I know.

463
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:12,975
But if you love me, too,
you won't do it.

464
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:16,186
[Gasps then grunts]

465
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,731
- I thought so.
- Okay.

466
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:22,234
Just for the record, I never really
wanted to do this in the first place,

467
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,403
me not doing it
is not a sign that I love you.

468
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,610
- It's just because I'm a coward.
- [Chuckles] Okay.

469
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,365
- I don't love you.
- Sure, you don't.

470
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,993
I don't. Come back here.
I don't love you.

471
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,120
You don't make me feel less broken.

472
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:37,541
I don't get it.

473
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:42,254
I singlehandedly got a lady footlocker
store employee a primetime show

474
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:46,592
and resurrected a certified dead man
and nobody cared.

475
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,470
- Why do I do anything?
- [Rutabaga over phone] Hey.

476
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:51,639
Do you need the movie star speech?

477
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,599
[Sighs] Yeah.

478
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:57,394
Okay.
Carolyn, you are the star of a movie.

479
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,397
This is the part of the movie
where you get your heart broken.

480
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,359
Where the world tests you,
and people treat you like shit.

481
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,110
But it has to happen this way.

482
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,570
Otherwise, the end of the movie,

483
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:09,782
when you get everything you want,
won't feel as rewarding.

484
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:13,953
There are assholes out there,
but in the end, they don't matter.

485
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,205
Because this movie's not about them.

486
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:17,748
It's never been about them.

487
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:21,460
All this time, the movie's been about you.

488
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:22,753
Thanks.

489
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:27,174
- Ca rolyn?
- Yes, rutabaga?

490
