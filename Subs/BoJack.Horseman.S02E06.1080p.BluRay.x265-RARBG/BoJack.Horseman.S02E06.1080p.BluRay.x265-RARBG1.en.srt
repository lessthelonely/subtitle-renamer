1
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:13,931
As your accountant,
I felt it necessary to do this in person.

2
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,558
Us, too. Because we're really
accounting on you...

3
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,852
- Oh no.
- To get in on the ground floor of this...

4
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,604
No, don't do this. Please, god, no.

5
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:21,813
Pb livin' product.

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,274
Has this ever happened to you?

7
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:27,444
Whatever it is, it hasn't happened.
Nothing has ever happened to me, stop.

8
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:30,614
- You say you love a toasted bagel.
- I would never say that.

9
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:33,909
- I have celiac disease.
- Ding. Bagel's ready.

10
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,577
- But wait.
- Son of a...

11
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:38,205
- Hey. That bagel was too fast.
- No.

12
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:41,583
That's why pb livin' presents,
the bagel catcher.

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,711
- For all those hard-to-catch bagels.
- No, no. Stop. Enough. Enough.

14
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,172
Stop talking. I can't take it anymore.

15
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:49,174
Pb livin' is filing for bankruptcy.

16
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:52,344
- I'm shutting you down.
- I thought you were a customer.

17
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:53,804
I don't get what's happening.

18
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:57,140
What's happening is you two knuckleheads
threw thousands of dollars

19
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,809
into a bunch of dumb ideas.

20
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:02,604
You paid 50 grand
to a bunch of kindergartners

21
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,940
for the movie rights
to the game "tag."

22
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,317
Our business manager
was over the moon for that.

23
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,945
Business manager?
Who the hell is your business manager?

24
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:14,575
Business-wise, this all seems
like appropriate business.

25
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,285
You two are done.

26
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:20,497
This company is more in the red
than Carrie on prom night.

27
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:25,460
So, what you're saying is, we're just
one great idea away from breaking even?

28
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,838
No. You're...
You are out of money.

29
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:31,592
Mr. Peanutbutter,
you need to get a job.

30
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:35,178
- Are you hiring at your accounting firm?
- Dude, no.

31
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:42,144
I'm waiting for my agent.
He'll be with me any moment.

32
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:44,813
Mr. Peanutbutter is going back to work.

33
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:49,109
Yeah. He's probably just organizing
all the amazing opportunities.

34
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:52,696
I haven't heard from him in years,
so they've probably been piling up.

35
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,699
Maybe I should just go check on him.

36
00:01:56,825 --> 00:02:00,370
Hello, Ronnie? It's your favorite client,
Mr. Peanutbutter.

37
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,206
Well, I'm coming in. I hope you're...
Oh! Oh, my god.

38
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,293
Ronnie, how'd you get that belt
around your neck,

39
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,854
then caught on the filing cabinet,
which made your pants fall down

40
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:11,798
while you were researching pornograph...
Oh, I see what happened here.

41
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,190
Morning time, hollywoo.

42
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:13,443
- I'm a Ryan seacrest type.
- And I'm some lady.

43
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,112
Here's a thing written on a card.

44
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:19,408
Last night, major hollywoo agent Ronnie
bonito was found dead in his office...

45
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,409
Ruh-roh.

46
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,912
In what authorities are calling
a mishap of a sexual nature.

47
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:28,417
- What does that mean?
- You know, auto-erotic asphyxiation.

48
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,293
Auto-a-what's it who's it?

49
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,213
Oh, is that that thing
where you strangle yourself

50
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,799
in an attempt to heighten
sexual arousal?

51
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,676
It sure is.

52
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,515
Coming up, a food truck that serves
just one thing: Gravy.

53
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:45,267
Did you hear that? New food truck.

54
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:46,685
- We should go.
- I'm in.

55
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:49,354
Hey, can I get some lunch money?
It's pizza day today.

56
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,606
Sure thing, sport.
Wait, where is it pizza day?

57
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,400
- In my tummy.
- 0h...

58
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,445
Hey, bojack, would you zip me up?
My shoulder is killing me.

59
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:59,698
I'm not sleeping right.
We need to do something about that bed.

60
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:02,492
Just because I'm nocturnal
doesn't mean I wanna be up all night.

61
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,245
- I propped it up with a golden globe.
- It still wobbles.

62
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,372
- Yeah. Anyway, I got you something.
- 0h.

63
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,375
A beeper? Bojack, it's great,
but you know, I already have one.

64
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,544
Yeah, you have a beeper, but I don't.

65
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:15,172
Now, you can page me
whenever you want.

66
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:18,842
Huh. Bojack, I love it,
and you're gonna love it, too.

67
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,136
There's all kinds of codes
we can send each other.

68
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,888
"Zero, zero, zero" is "call me,"

69
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,434
and "1-2-3“ is "I miss you"
and "8-0-0-8-5" is boobs.

70
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,561
What? Boobs? Oh, my god.

71
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,396
What scamp came up with that one?

72
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,190
Okay, I gotta go. Dinner tonight?

73
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,734
Totally. Let's hit that gravy truck.

74
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,861
Okay, love you.

75
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,825
No, I don't.

76
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:48,163
Aw... "I love you. No, I don't"?

77
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,792
Uh... keys.

78
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,126
Uh-oh.

79
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:00,884
Get out.

80
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,648
Hold it. Hold the elevator.

81
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,692
Ooh. Ah. Ee. Ow.

82
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,736
Goddam it. No. No. Ow.

83
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,280
Oh. Ow. Oh...

84
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,741
Coffee? Hup.

85
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,410
Rutabaga, this day already sucks.

86
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,746
My heel broke
while I was at this new food truck,

87
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:32,165
and I spilled a handful of gravy
all over myself

88
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,335
because they don't sell bowls,
just gravy.

89
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,421
Should've gone to the bowl truck first.
That's where they get you.

90
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,174
Well, I guess the upside to being
invisible around here

91
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,469
is that none of these assholes
will ever notice what a mess I am.

92
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:47,196
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
I see what a mess you are.

93
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,515
Aw...

94
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,475
Do you need the movie-star speech?

95
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:53,645
No, no, I'll be okay.
And how are you?

96
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,605
Gotta look at paint for the new kitchen.

97
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,372
I have to pick a shade that won't clash
with the splatter of blood

98
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,777
from when I blow my brains out
after talking to Katie

99
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,947
about paint swatches all day.

100
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,740
We do have fun.

101
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:13,123
So, what's the plan for today?
Find a new agent, go on auditions?

102
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:17,711
No, I'm gonna do exactly what landed me
Mr. Peanutbutter's house, oh, so long ago.

103
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,838
Wander around L.A. with an open mind

104
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:22,382
and an empty stomach
until I get discovered.

105
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:25,260
But also, like, find a new agent
and go on auditions, right?

106
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,304
Or should I start stealing food
from work?

107
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,640
I'm just gonna go with the flow
and leave everything up to destiny.

108
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:34,269
- Que sera quesadilla.
- You know we could lose the house, right?

109
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,271
- Diane.
- Right?

110
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,440
Diane, Diane, Diane.

111
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:49,910
- Diane.
- Aah!

112
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,829
I wasn't stealing paper towels
to use as dinner napkins. Why?

113
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,331
Here's a funny question for you:

114
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,875
If Mr. Peanutbutter said,
"I love you. No, I don't,"

115
00:06:57,042 --> 00:07:00,170
would you need to talk about that later
and figure out what he meant by that?

116
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,964
Probably not, right?
Because they're meaningless words?

117
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,716
I mean, language evolves, right?

118
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,635
How can anyone know
what anything means?

119
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,929
The answer is nobody can.
Nothing means anything.

120
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,805
So why bother talking about anything?

121
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,892
In this scenario, are Mr. Peanutbutter
and I living in our house?

122
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:17,562
Or are we squatting in an abandoned
Barnes & noble burning books to keep warm

123
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,023
as we struggle through
our dickensian-style poverty?

124
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,819
"Zero, zero, zero."
No idea what that means.

125
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,237
I think it means "call me."

126
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,698
Ignore. Wait, where's the ignore button?

127
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:29,991
How do I ignore?

128
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,619
I think with a beeper, you just ignore it.

129
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,622
- With what, my mind?
- You seem a little stressed out.

130
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,832
That's because
as soon as I'm done with work,

131
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,918
I have to have a long,
awkward conversation

132
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:44,339
with Wanda about our relationship,
unless I'm never done with work.

133
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,676
Diane, you magnificent bastard. That's it.

134
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,141
I'll be out there in the stands.

135
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,185
And I'll be rooting for you, secretariat.

136
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,647
Mm. Yeah.

137
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,987
Your line is,
"and I'll see you at the finish line."

138
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,949
Yeah, I know. I'm acting.
Great. Now I gotta start all over.

139
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,284
Settle in, folks.
We could be here a while.

140
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,082
- Ow! Ooh.
- Ah, Princess Carolyn.

141
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,835
So good of you to join us eventually.

142
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,129
Sorry I'm late. I had the worst morning.

143
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,673
You know who had an even
"the worst-er" morning?

144
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,759
- Ronnie bonito. Because he's dead.
- He is?

145
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,012
He decided to strangle the dirty dangle

146
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,807
and now that sweet chariot
has come fore to carry him home.

147
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:39,019
Everyone who was here on time
is taking a moment.

148
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,063
- Of silence?
- Yes.

149
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,150
Also to reach out to his former clients.

150
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,861
- To offer their condolences?
- Yes.

151
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,739
Also to recruit them to the vigor roster.

152
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:54,075
- A vigor agent is a vigorous agent.
- Who do you want me to call?

153
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:58,079
I have ins with a bunch of bonito's
clients including all the major j's:

154
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:02,125
- Law, lo, leno, and j. Abrams.
- Oh, that's wonderful news

155
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:05,628
in the parallel universe
in which you were on time today.

156
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,548
In this reality, however, we're all good.

157
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,800
You can lap up the leftovers though.

158
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,595
- "Mr. Peanutbutter"?
- Oh, and Princess Carolyn?

159
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:14,846
Get your shoe fixed.

160
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,932
You look like a woman
from an '805 deodorant commercial.

161
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,193
Here I go.
Destiny, don't fail me now.

162
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,697
Yeah. Hitting the pavement.

163
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:35,116
This is how it happens for a guy like me.

164
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,708
Ew...

165
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,960
Out of my way, flyer.

166
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:50,840
Ugh. Flyer. Why do you have to be
on my shoe in front of this store?

167
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,343
Wait, a second. Shoe.

168
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,053
Store.

169
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,806
Shoe store? Shoe store.

170
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,557
"Team players wanted"?

171
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,601
Oh, I'm such a good team player,

172
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,687
I make all the other team players
look like garbage.

173
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:08,024
Lady footlocker, meet your lord.

174
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,698
Finish...

175
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,160
Line.

176
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,163
Great, we got it. We got one take.

177
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,957
And now we gotta stop for the day.

178
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,208
What? No. Why stop now?

179
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:29,003
- I'm just getting warmed up.
- Union rules. We're done. Go home.

180
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,213
Go home?

181
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,175
Why go home when we could extend
this long day's journey into night?

182
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,928
- Drinks on me, folks.
- I could use a drink.

183
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,681
- Or six.
- Great, corduroy's driving. Let's go.

184
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,267
Ah...

185
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,311
- I really needed this, bojack.
- Me, too.

186
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,689
Yeah, man.
This day's been really hard on me.

187
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:50,900
Ever since I heard about that agent
who died from that blue-face blastoff?

188
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,902
- Blue-face blastoff?
- The strokey chokey?

189
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,362
- The two-neck squeeze?
- What?

190
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,739
You know, the one hand
on the Adam's apple,

191
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,867
the other one's
on the Adam's banana?

192
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:02,078
Oh, right. Right. Yeah. The auto-erotic...

193
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:04,965
That could've been me, you know.
I used to really be into that stuff.

194
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,624
I was a hard-core gasper.

195
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,511
Can't believe you have
so many names for it.

196
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,086
Now I can't stop thinking about it.

197
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,297
I shouldn't even be alive right now.

198
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,191
Don't need to talk about
how you masturbate.

199
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,342
- The orgasms you get...
- Okay, I guess we do.

200
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,137
It's like seeing a rainbow,
but with all the colors.

201
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,890
- So, like a normal rainbow?
- But it's too dangerous, man.

202
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:25,059
They say if you bite down on a lemon
right at the point of climax,

203
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:28,688
the lemon juice gives you the jolt
you need to not pass out and die.

204
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:32,859
But still man,
you're just... rolling the dice.

205
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,986
Okay, this is getting really graphic.

206
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,821
Can we maybe
talk about anything else?

207
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,573
- Sure.
- Thank god.

208
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:43,119
Hey, man, it's funny you should mention
god, because my new thing is... the Bible.

209
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:48,625
Tell me, have you accepted Jesus Christ
as your lord and personal savior?

210
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,836
So, noose-wise, what are we talking?
You use a standard sailor's knot

211
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,880
or more like your average
birthday-present bow?

212
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,808
- I beeped you, bojack.
- Oh, hey. About this morning...

213
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,810
- It's fine.
- Because when I said that...

214
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,104
I said it's fine. You don't love me.

215
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,024
That's okay. I don't love you.

216
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:15,735
- What?
- Good night.

217
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,281
Morning time, hollywoo.

218
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,409
- I'm a Ryan seacrest type.
- And I'm some lady.

219
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,454
On today's show,
I sit down with Hank hippopopalous

220
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,958
to discuss his new smash hit,
hey, I think you can dance.

221
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,918
Can you talk about your process?

222
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,087
When I see someone,
and I think they can dance,

223
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,048
I say,
"hey, I think you can dance."

224
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:41,386
And when I think they can't dance,
I say, "no, I don't think you can dance."

225
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,222
- And that is pretty much it.
- Fascinating.

226
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,309
- So, last night when...
- Bojack, it's not a big deal.

227
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,228
You don't love me, I don't love you.

228
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,480
We're having a good time. It's fine.

229
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,649
Can't just say, "I don't love you"
to someone.

230
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,110
- You said it to me.
- Yeah, but that was different.

231
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,862
- How was that different?
- Because you do love me. Right?

232
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,447
- Like a little bit?
- No.

233
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,909
Uh, for what it's worth,
I love both you guys.

234
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:06,661
Shut up, Todd. Grown-ups are talking.

235
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,459
Here you go, ma'am.

236
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:19,215
Jessica Atkinson, come on down.

237
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,508
Mr. Peanutbutter?

238
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:25,388
Would you like to see what's in
box number one or box number two?

239
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:29,600
Either way,
it's a brand-new pair of shoes!

240
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,275
Hup. Carolyn.

241
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:38,609
- Ruta baga...
- Coffee?

242
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,862
I was thinking about you last night

243
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:44,490
while Katie and I were locked in a
fascinating debate about counter granite.

244
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,994
And what if I told you I used to work
Ronnie bonito's desk,

245
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:51,039
and I happen to know
that he had a client so hush-hush,

246
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:55,335
- it wasn't even on the master list.
- What? Who? Tell me. Whoa!

247
00:13:56,419 --> 00:14:00,882
Beloved novelist j.D. Salinger. What?

248
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,051
The author of catcher in the rye?

249
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,428
- And... others?
- Yuh-huh.

250
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,972
- Isn't he dead?
- He's "reclusive."

251
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:12,185
Dude wanted to be left alone so much,
he faked his own death.

252
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,394
Oh, my god.

253
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,229
Why are you giving this lead to me?

254
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,940
- Because I like you, dummy.
- Huh.

255
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:21,527
Now we gotta wait for the fire department
to come let us out of this elevator.

256
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,159
- Hey.
- Corduroy, what are you doing here?

257
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:30,370
I need a favor.
Can you hold on to this for me?

258
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,914
- Ew. Is this your Bible?
- No, no, no.

259
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,957
- It's my choking-off kit.
- Your kit?

260
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,334
Yeah. It has all my supplies.

261
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:39,420
Silk ties, a leather gag, velvet sock.
Lemon.

262
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,507
You gotta take this off my hands.
I can't trust myself with this.

263
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,753
I don't know if I want
your Jack-off kit at my house.

264
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,969
Please. I got this girlfriend.
She loves me.

265
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:50,181
If I fall back into the old gasp-and-goo,
it'll break her heart.

266
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:53,059
Wait. So, you're saying
if someone loves you,

267
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,853
they don't want you to choke yourself
while masturbating?

268
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,855
Yeah. It's really dangerous.

269
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,941
- All right. I'll take it.
- Thanks, bojack.

270
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,984
I still don't understand
why you need a kit.

271
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,028
Can't you just use,
like, a belt or a rope?

272
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:06,030
Oh, I guess.

273
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:07,949
I mean, I guess you could use anything.

274
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:12,161
I mean, you could use an iPhone charger,
a shoelace, a necktie, a jump-rope...

275
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,585
Hm...

276
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,466
Oh. Ooh.

277
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,553
- Oh, hello. I'm looking for some...
- Sorry, no looking allowed.

278
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,304
This store is for customers only.

279
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:34,016
Okay, then, I would like to buy a bicycle.
What would you recommend?

280
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,144
- One with a bell, or...?
- You got me.

281
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:40,314
I don't know anything about bicycles.
I'm j.D. Salinger. I faked my own death.

282
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:45,153
Mr. Salinger. Such a pleasure.
Princess Carolyn, big fan.

283
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,155
Let me guess, catcher in the rye?

284
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,031
And others.

285
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,951
- I wanna say the hobbi...
- Nope.

286
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,327
Look. I'm an agent.

287
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,455
It doesn't matter
whether I've read your work.

288
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:59,542
What matters is I can look you
in the eye and tell you I'm a big fan.

289
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,545
The world is ready for your comeback,
and I wanna help.

290
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,088
No, thank you. Not interested.

291
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,007
Did that before, didn't work out well.

292
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,134
Fans were relentless.
The critics were cruel.

293
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,429
And that's why my motto is,
"it's better to be alone."

294
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,181
Which, come to think of it,

295
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,766
is probably why I don't sell
a lot of tandem bicycles.

296
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,644
But, j.D. Salinger,
you are j.D. Salinger.

297
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,938
You are a goddamn American treasure.

298
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:24,442
But every time I go out in the world,
people hound me about my books.

299
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:26,194
Well, book.

300
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,238
What if I told you there was a place
where no one reads books?

301
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,406
I'm listening.

302
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:33,576
A place where people only read
headlines, lists and pictures.

303
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:36,078
A place where people
hate reading so much,

304
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,624
they hire others to do it for them
and don't even pay a living wage.

305
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,543
What do you mean,
like, modern reading slaves?

306
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,003
Exactly.

307
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,547
And all those modern reading slaves
really wanna be doing

308
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:50,259
is writing things that, one day,
other people will also avoid reading.

309
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,971
- Does such a place truly exist?
- Come with me, j.D. Salinger.

310
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,681
Let's go to hollywoo.

311
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:07,652
Oh...

312
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,111
- Hey.
- Hey.

313
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,780
- We need to talk.
- Okay.

314
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,033
You're probably wondering
what this beautiful mahogany box is.

315
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,411
- I wasn't wondering that.
- It's my auto-erotic asphyxiation kit.

316
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,956
I've decided to do the funky spider-man.

317
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,583
- What? Funky spider-man?
- I came up with that one myself.

318
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,544
Its because he hangs,
then he shoots webbing.

319
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,339
Wait. Are you saying you want to
auto-erotic asphyxiate yourself?

320
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:29,632
Yes. I do.

321
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,342
Even though it's very dangerous

322
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,094
- and I could die.
- Oh.

323
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:36,305
Now, if you love me, you probably
wouldn't want me to do it.

324
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,517
- Okay. I get it.
- Since you don't, I should do it, right?

325
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:42,520
I mean, there's no reason not to...
Unless you love me.

326
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,146
- Do it.
- Wait. Seriously?

327
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,033
Seems like you've already
made up your mind.

328
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,109
If you're that set on it,
knock yourself out.

329
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:50,736
Only if I do it wrong.

330
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,447
Because as I mentioned before,
it's very dangerous.

331
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,992
- Have fun.
- I'm serious. I'm really gonna do it.

332
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:59,328
Great. Put a towel down.
Not one of the good ones.

333
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,540
Morning time, hollywoo.

334
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,417
I'm a Ryan seacrest type.

335
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:07,962
And I'm an actress or something,
I don't know, sitting in for some lady.

336
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:10,506
- Whoa. What happened to her?
- She got kidnapped.

337
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,174
Oh, boy.

338
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:15,469
Oh, my. Ooh, wow.

339
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,723
Oh, hey. Look who survived
to masturbate another day.

340
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,600
Well, I didn't do it yet, obviously.

341
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,518
If I'm gonna do it,
I'm gonna go all out.

342
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:25,605
A big job like that needs lumber,
and pulleys, lemons, so forth.

343
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:29,108
I'm not gonna half-ass anything.
This is my orgasm we're talking about.

344
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,360
Okay. Well, I wish you all the best.

345
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,654
- Not too late to stop me.
- I'm not gonna stop you.

346
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,073
- Good 'cause don't.
- All right, we're in agreement.

347
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,450
Stop fighting!

348
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,577
Can't you two see
what this is doing to me?

349
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:42,204
I've been acting out.

350
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,498
Have a great day.

351
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,250
Todd? Get in the car.

352
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:49,211
It's time to get serious
about auto-erotic asphyxiation.

353
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,548
Hooray! Question Mark?

354
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:59,430
Just play it cool, Todd.
No one needs to know why we're here.

355
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:02,767
Excuse me, I'm looking for something
that will hold up a lot of weight.

356
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:06,646
Let's say something that could hoist up
a horse comfortably by the neck.

357
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,273
Not for suicide purposes.

358
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,151
I'm trying to have
a more fulfilling orgasm.

359
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,741
The world wept when news broke
that j.D. Salinger died.

360
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,703
- 'J.D. Salinger died?
- But I'm here to tell you, he didn't die.

361
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,580
J.D. Salinger didn't die?

362
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,625
As one of the 20th century's
most celebrated authors,

363
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,670
j.d. Salinger has inspired
countless dreamers,

364
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,089
eighth graders
and occasionally, assassins.

365
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:36,175
His spare lyricism
and devotion to character

366
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:40,012
will undoubtedly translate into
a penetrating dramatic work for this,

367
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,223
the golden age of television writing.

368
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,141
J.d. Take it away.

369
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:48,521
I wanna do a show where people
ask celebrities trivia questions.

370
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,189
- What?
- Like a game show?

371
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,525
Yeah. You know because
since they're famous people,

372
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:55,945
well I think normal people would wanna see
if they know trivia and stuff.

373
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:59,615
You know, like, hollywoo stars
and celebrities, what do they know?

374
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,951
Do they know things? Let's find out.

375
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:05,496
What a hoot. I love it, and I don't
use that word with just anybody.

376
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:06,497
What do you call it?

377
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:10,042
I call it hollywoo stars and
celebrities: What do they know?

378
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,253
Do they know things?
Let's find out.

379
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,088
It's maybe more of a working title.

380
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:16,006
I can see it on the marquee already.

381
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,675
- Must be a long marquee.
- It's long.

382
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:20,636
Yeah, yeah. The celebrities
can also do physical challenges.

383
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:21,554
Oh, it's perfect.

384
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,974
We've been searching for a companion
for hey, I think you can dance.

385
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,393
But wait, wait one second.
Who's gonna host?

386
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,396
Huh. I've got the perfect guy.

387
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,691
Who wants to be in Nike airs?

388
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,486
Claire, you are looking off the charts
"gorg" in those tennis shoes.

389
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:41,407
But let me ask you this:
Would you like to buy a towel?

390
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,201
Because I'm throwing one in for free.

391
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,203
- He's perfect.
- Mm-hm.

392
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,538
Mr. Peanutbutter?

393
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:52,626
How would you like to be the host of
j.D. Salinger's new celebrity game show?

394
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:56,088
What? I knew destiny had a plan for me.

395
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,007
You know, it just goes to show,

396
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:00,676
with the right attitude,
every single one of your dreams

397
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,344
will always come true.

398
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,138
And if your dreams don't come true,

399
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:08,058
it's probably because you just
didn't have the right attitude.

400
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:14,940
Today, one agent did something
that no one else could.

401
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,943
I'll give you two hints: Catcher and rye.

402
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,779
Oh. Nothing. It's nothing.

403
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:24,033
Charley Witherspoon caught a rye bagel
coming out of the toaster.

404
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,077
- Come again?
- It was coming fast and hot.

405
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:30,748
One day, some genius will invent
some sort of bagel catcher

406
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,750
that takes the guesswork out of this task,

407
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:36,128
but until then, Charley gets a gold star.

408
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:40,466
- Thanks, dad. I mean, Mr. Dad.
- Oh...

409
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,971
Oh, boy.

410
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,640
Hey. Wasn't sure if I'd see you.

411
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:51,310
Still alive? Because auto-erotic
asphyxiation is so risky?

412
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,103
Well, here I am, for now.

413
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,648
Bojack... wait.
Did you fix the bed?

414
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,399
Yeah. I was at the hardware store

415
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:00,778
picking up supplies for my auto-erotic
asphyxiation machine.

416
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,196
Because, as you are aware,

417
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:05,407
I'm preparing to auto-erotic
asphyxiate myself.

418
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:09,411
Figured I'd get stuff for the bed so you
could at least get a good night's sleep.

419
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,330
Okay, bojack.

420
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,374
Wanna talk about
the elephant in the room?

421
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,752
Wow. Okay. You know what?

422
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,421
You know what? Here's... first of all...

423
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:23,759
Wow. All right, I can't even...

424
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,512
You know what?

425
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:27,513
Wow.

426
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,390
He is never gonna forget that.

427
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:30,599
What is this all about?

428
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,561
This isn't about anything but
the pursuit of the kind of orgasm

429
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,938
that feels like a rainbow
with every color.

430
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,523
- So, a regular rainbow.
- No.

431
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,442
So, if you don't mind,
as long as you don't love me,

432
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,987
I have a noose to step into.

433
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,947
I just need to release this lever,

434
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:47,366
drop these bags of sand,
which act as counterweights,

435
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,952
and then just pull this nozzle.

436
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,413
- Perfect.
- Okay. Have fun.

437
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:56,625
- Wait, Wanda.
- Okay, fine, you stupid baby.

438
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,127
I love you.

439
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:01,422
I... I knew it.

440
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:05,009
But I'm not going to tell you
not to do the funky spider-man.

441
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:08,053
- What?
- You need to be responsible for yourself.

442
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,972
- That doesn't sound like me.
- I know.

443
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:12,975
But if you love me, too,
you won't do it.

444
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,731
- I thought so.
- Okay.

445
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:22,234
Just for the record, I never really
wanted to do this in the first place,

446
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,403
me not doing it
is not a sign that I love you.

447
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,610
- It's just because I'm a coward.
- Okay.

448
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,365
- I don't love you.
- Sure, you don't.

449
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,993
I don't. Come back here.
I don't love you.

450
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,120
You don't make me feel less broken.

451
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:37,541
I don't get it.

452
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:42,254
I singlehandedly got a lady footlocker
store employee a primetime show

453
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:46,592
and resurrected a certified dead man
and nobody cared.

454
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,470
- Why do I do anything?
- Hey.

455
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:51,639
Do you need the movie star speech?

456
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,599
Yeah.

457
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:57,394
Okay.
Carolyn, you are the star of a movie.

458
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,397
This is the part of the movie
where you get your heart broken.

459
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,359
Where the world tests you,
and people treat you like shit.

460
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,110
But it has to happen this way.

461
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,570
Otherwise, the end of the movie,

462
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:09,782
when you get everything you want,
won't feel as rewarding.

463
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:13,953
There are assholes out there,
but in the end, they don't matter.

464
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,205
Because this movie's not about them.

465
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:17,748
It's never been about them.

466
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:21,460
All this time, the movie's been about you.

467
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:22,753
Thanks.

468
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:27,174
- Ca rolyn?
- Yes, rutabaga?

469
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:30,552
I think Katie and I are getting a divorce.

470
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:34,264
Corduroy? I don't want this thing anymore.

471
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,100
Corduroy?

472
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,309
Hey, you decent, man?

473
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,105
Oh, sweet Jesus.

474
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,357
J“ back in the 905 j“

475
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:48,487
j“ I was in a very famous TV show j“

476
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,950
j“ I'm bojack the horse
bojack! J'

477
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:57,246
j“ bojack the horse
don't act like you don't know j“

478
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:04,044
j“ and I'm trying to hold on to my past j“

479
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:09,008
j“ it's been so long
I don't think I'm gonna last j“

480
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:12,720
j“ I guess I'm just trying
to make you understand j“

481
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:16,932
j“ that I'm more horse than a man j“

482
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:20,978
j' or I'm more man than a horse j“

483
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:22,271
j“ bojack! J'j'
