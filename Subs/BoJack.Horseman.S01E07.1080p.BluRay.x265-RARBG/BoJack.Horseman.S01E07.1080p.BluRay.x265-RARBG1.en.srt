1
00:00:05,756 --> 00:00:08,675
[Princess carolynjyou got to get
your shit together.

2
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,345
So you took some licks,
but you're gonna bounce back,

3
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,430
because you're talented,
you're smart,

4
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:15,140
and damn it, you're good.

5
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:17,601
You are a goddamn American
treasure, you know that?

6
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:21,396
You are bojack goddamn horseman.

7
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:23,106
So get the hell off my lawn.

8
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,611
Here I thought I was at the
drive-through at Carl's Jr.

9
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:29,446
How much did I have to drink
last night?

10
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:31,740
Last night?
Oh, you've been on a bender

11
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:33,968
for the last two weeks ever
since you found out Diane

12
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,261
got engaged to Mr. Peanutbutter.

13
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,204
Diane got engaged
to Mr. Peanutbutter?

14
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,456
- I need a drink.
- No. No more drinking.

15
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:41,542
You've been out of control.

16
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,753
Princess Carolyn, look.
I met John stamos.

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,547
That is not John stamos.

18
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:47,965
Hey, Princess Carolyn,

19
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,509
John stamos and I
got our ears pierced.

20
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:51,885
That is not your ear.

21
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:55,389
Princess Carolyn,
John stamos died.

22
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,766
Why? Why, god?

23
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:00,185
Why did you take John stamos?

24
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:01,979
That doesn't sound so bad.

25
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,385
Oh, I forgot to mention you
were naked for a lot of that.

26
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:07,943
Stamos!

27
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,612
Also, it wasn't here.
It was at my office.

28
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,698
We thought night swimming
would be fun,

29
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:15,659
but the current was too strong.

30
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:17,661
Oh, god, I wasn't
driving around, was I?

31
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:19,830
No. You made Todd
your designated driver,

32
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,957
but then you also made him
drink with you.

33
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:25,377
Yeah, I'll have
a western bacon cheeseburger.

34
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:27,754
Bojack, we are going
to get you back on your feet.

35
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,756
All you need to do
is get off Diane

36
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,174
and get on to something else.

37
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,634
Hello?

38
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,177
Tony, hl
I'm calling in that favor.

39
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,944
Get your crew
to bojack horseman's house.

40
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,556
Can you be there in an hour?

41
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:38,974
- Yeah.
- Great.

42
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:40,434
What just happened?

43
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,102
You're the new face
of guten bourbon.

44
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:43,395
What is guten bourbon?

45
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:44,664
It's an urban German bourbon.

46
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:47,149
Am I just hungover, or are
you talking like a muppet?

47
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:48,942
They're looking
for American celebrities

48
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,712
to talk about how much
they like to drink.

49
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:52,321
It's the part
you were born to play.

50
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:55,157
All you have to do is smile
and stay upright.

51
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:57,200
I don't know.
It sounds like a lot of work.

52
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,703
You take up 80% of my time
with your drama

53
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,622
and make me 0% of my money.

54
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,788
Do the damn commercial.

55
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,210
7:00 A.M. breakfast
with Lenny turteltaub.

56
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,755
Okay, I got to go.
You're in charge, Todd.

57
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,757
Keep this dummy out of trouble.

58
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,216
Hooray, responsibility.

59
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,010
Hey.

60
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:18,013
Do you really believe all that
stuff you said to me earlier

61
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,891
about me being smart
and talented and good?

62
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:25,395
Bojack, I'm an agent.
I believe everything I say.

63
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,441
Hey, where the hell
is that cheeseburger?

64
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,151
I ordered it, like, an hour ago.

65
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,234
Lenny turteltaub,
you skinny bitch.

66
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,877
How the hell are you?

67
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,589
I'm in a hurry,
so I'll make this... snappy.

68
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,109
I got some great news about
the picture

69
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,133
we're putting together.

70
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,511
Sorry. Hello?

71
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:42,723
Hey, I just wanted to thank
you for getting me this job

72
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,351
and pulling me out of that
oh-so-predictably bojack

73
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,079
spiral of self-loathing
and substance abuse.

74
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,522
- You really are the best.
- I know. Talk to you later.

75
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:53,316
I feel like you see things
in me that nobody else sees.

76
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,818
Yep, I'm pretty great.
Got to go.

77
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,528
All this time, I never even...

78
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,339
Bojack, I'm in a very
important breakfast right now.

79
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,115
- Okay. I got to go too.
- Sorry.

80
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:01,450
What's the great news?

81
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:04,911
- We got braff.
- You beautiful dickhead.

82
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,913
You finally got Zach braff?

83
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,416
Ah, no other director
has enough weight

84
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,002
to handle a movie about
the last days of Eva braun.

85
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,169
No shit, toots.

86
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,839
Ooh, ooh, ooh. There you go.

87
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,132
Thank you, sweetheart.

88
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:18,443
Everything's coming together.

89
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:19,676
With braff directing,

90
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,112
my client Cate blanchett
starring,

91
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,430
and the great
Lenny turteltaub producing,

92
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,307
this movie is a done deal.

93
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,285
Look, honey, I been in this
business a long time, okay?

94
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,643
Long time.

95
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,188
And as I once said
to a young ed begley sr.,

96
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,523
"it ain't a done deal
till the deals are all done."

97
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,150
I'm the best agent in the biz.

98
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:38,195
I can seal these deals
with my paws in my pants.

99
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,964
Well, then I'll say to you
what I once said

100
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,657
to a young buster Keaton,
“what?"

101
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,587
Laura! What's happening?

102
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,589
- We're merging.
- No shit. With what?

103
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,424
Fme. A bunch of people
got laid off,

104
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,635
and some of the fmeers
are already moving in.

105
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,553
It's all so sudden
and unexpected.

106
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,474
It was not handled well.

107
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,935
Oh, shit. Don't tell me
one of the new agents is...

108
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,436
Vanessa gekko.

109
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:14,773
That slippery, slimy,
cold-blooded, bug-eyed...

110
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,191
What's new, pussycat?

111
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,068
- Gekko.
- In the flesh.

112
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,278
Ha ha. How are you?

113
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,113
What a morning, huh?

114
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,449
I was in the middle
of my second soul cycle class

115
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:25,616
when I got the news.

116
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,285
- Can you imagine?
- No.

117
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,663
I was so excited, I rushed home,

118
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,873
made love
to my husband of 15 years,

119
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,125
made a hot breakfast
for my three wonderful girls,

120
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,878
read to them, dropped them off
at their elite private school,

121
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,005
and then got my ass here
as quick as I could.

122
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,050
- How old are your kids now?
- I don't have any children.

123
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,970
Oh, well, it'll happen.
You're still...

124
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,390
- Anyway...
- Princess Carolyn.

125
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:52,435
I see you've already met
a new member of the team.

126
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,855
- Vanessa gekko, sir.
- I know that.

127
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,982
This merger is very exciting.

128
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,775
- I'm pumped.
- I'm beyond pumped.

129
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,319
You should be, or at least
I think you should be.

130
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,989
It's hard to keep track
of who's getting promoted

131
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,074
- and who's getting fired.
- Oh.

132
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:09,619
You're probably fine or not.
Who knows?

133
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,164
Ugh. What do you want, Todd?

134
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,208
Well, good news, bad news.

135
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,420
The bad news is that there
actually is no good news,

136
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:21,131
and the other bad news
is bojack's gone.

137
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:23,800
What? Where did he go?
The shoot is at his house.

138
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,428
He just disappeared. I don't
even know why he'd leave.

139
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,680
This charcoal mellow bourbon
is so smooth,

140
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:32,017
every time I take a sip,
pure happiness.

141
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,810
- That was amazing.
- Really?

142
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,562
Can I get you to say that
in a tuxedo?

143
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,569
Hey, I got to go.
I think this is my big break.

144
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,900
Don't worry. I won't let it
get to my head or anything.

145
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,778
Hey, who told that asshole
he could sit in my chair?

146
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,239
Don't forget I'm your agent
too... I want 10%.

147
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,574
Hello, beautiful.

148
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,159
What the hell
are you doing here?

149
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,046
You're supposed to be
shooting a commercial.

150
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,097
I know, but I was sitting
there drinking bourbon and...

151
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,721
They didn't give you
fake bourbon on set?

152
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,601
Oh, they did, and then
I just mixed it with bourbon.

153
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,001
And it hit me.

154
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,008
Why was I so upset
about Diane getting engaged?

155
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,297
You're the one who's always
been there for me,

156
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:03,798
so I drank a lot more bourbon

157
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,842
and drove over to tell you
how I feel.

158
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,510
Oh, I see what this is.

159
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,930
Princess Carolyn,
what are we doing?

160
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,057
Clearly we're in love
with each other.

161
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,201
You're not in love with me.
You're in love with Diane.

162
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,977
And you're not even
really in love with her.

163
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,622
You just think you are
because you pay her

164
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,086
to listen to you
talk about yourself.

165
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,291
Diane getting engaged
was the best thing

166
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:21,775
that ever happened to me.

167
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,444
It made me realize you're
the one I need to be with.

168
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:28,031
Ha! You say that every time
something bad happens.

169
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,884
Not getting nominated
for a people's choice award

170
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,588
is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

171
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,994
It made me realize...

172
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,761
Getting caught
with that pound of cocaine

173
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,549
was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

174
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:37,999
That hooker getting pregnant

175
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,435
was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

176
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,169
Sneezing on Marisa tomei
was the best...

177
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,630
Every time
something bad happens,

178
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,674
you come running to me
for comfort.

179
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,550
Well, it's not gonna happen
this time.

180
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,761
I can't be your agent
and your girlfriend.

181
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:51,513
It just doesn't work.

182
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,390
I have Lenny turteltaub for you.

183
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,849
- I have to take this.
- Okay.

184
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,394
But remember,
I'm coming for you,

185
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,021
and I'm gonna make you love me.

186
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,940
Please don't. Hey.

187
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,566
Bad news, p.C.

188
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,127
Braff used your merger as
an opportunity to jump ship.

189
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,695
Aw, fish.

190
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,114
Now his new agent's
asking for twice the money.

191
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,366
As I once said
to a young Lionel Barrymore,

192
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,451
"eh, shut up.“

193
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,621
without a director, Eva
braun is as dead as Eva braun.

194
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,068
Yep. You got to get someone big.

195
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,542
- What about those bro...
- Hello? Hello?

196
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,085
Lady, you work too hard.

197
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,129
That was
an important phone call.

198
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,256
Important phone call
beep boop blorp.

199
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:27,841
Don't you robot-voice me.

200
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,343
Princess Carolyn,
what are we doing?

201
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,721
Well, I'm working,
and you are leaving.

202
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,098
Before I go, I got you
a little sexy something

203
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,641
to remember me by.

204
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,643
Since we can't be together
every second,

205
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,188
which would be my preference,
I give you cardboard bojack.

206
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,624
It's got
a light-sensitive sound chip,

207
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,808
so every time you walk by it,

208
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,293
it quotes a line
from Jerry Maguire,

209
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,402
your favorite movie.

210
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:48,879
You complete me.

211
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,172
What do you think?
Pretty sweet, huh?

212
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,799
You had me at "hello."

213
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,825
I don't have time for you
or cardboard you.

214
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,192
I need to find a new director.

215
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,246
Or you could find
my nude erector...

216
00:08:58,413 --> 00:08:59,413
She's gone.

217
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,962
Blech. Word to the wise, Laura...

218
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,757
Do not pitch a Nazi romance
to Steven Spielberg.

219
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,258
Just thought you should know

220
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:11,705
there's been some reorganization

221
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,779
- vis-a-vis resource management.
- What are you saying?

222
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,483
You and Vanessa gekko
are sharing an office

223
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,223
until they can find her
a permanent one.

224
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,142
- The hell we are.
- Also...

225
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,162
Good news, Princess Carolyn.
Vanessa's my agent now.

226
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,771
What?

227
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,915
You said you couldn't be
my girlfriend and my agent,

228
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,441
so I'm firing you.

229
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,068
Now we can be in love.

230
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,987
- Hope you like money, bojack.
- This is so great.

231
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,823
Now I can date you
and have a better agent.

232
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,408
- Everybody wins.
- Oh.

233
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,826
I'm a sporting agent.

234
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:40,121
Are you still
searching for happiness?

235
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,582
Make your own happiness.

236
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:46,086
Mmm, that's some guten bourbon.

237
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,754
Cut. That was great.

238
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,173
Was it? You know, I'm trying
to do good work here,

239
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,134
really find the character,
but it's pretty distracting

240
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,636
to have all these robots

241
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,805
staring at me
with their blinking red eyes.

242
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,641
Those are cameras, Todd.
We're making a commercial.

243
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,518
Oh, well,
you want to make a good one?

244
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,561
Then get them
the hell out of here!

245
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:07,148
I'm the face of this brand,
I'm the man behind the thing,

246
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,150
and I'm determined
to get the jargon

247
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:13,196
of this German bourbon blurbon.

248
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:14,799
Is it just me,
or does this fake booze

249
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:16,574
taste a lot like real booze?

250
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,369
You want bojack,
you can have him.

251
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,536
Here's a list of directors
who won't work with him,

252
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,081
studios that won't hire him,

253
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,391
former assistants
with restraining orders.

254
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,667
This is great.

255
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:27,127
You know, it gets kind of boring

256
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,170
when all your clients
are in such demand,

257
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,005
they practically
find their own jobs.

258
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,550
Well, then bojack should be
a lot of fun for you.

259
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,927
No one wants to hire him.

260
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:39,556
Hello. We're looking
for bojack horseman's agent.

261
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,599
We'd like to discuss

262
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,768
a very lucrative business
opportunity.

263
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:46,020
- You gotta be kidding me.
- I'm bojack's agent.

264
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,149
The opportunity
is we're blackmailing you.

265
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,900
Ha. All yours.

266
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,485
Needless to say,

267
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,029
it would be a shame
if these pictures got out.

268
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,407
Fortunately, that can
easily be avoided

269
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:03,413
by simply paying me
and my partner here $150.

270
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,706
Each.

271
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:06,033
Let me just get my checkbook.

272
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,082
Huh?

273
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,543
Whoa.

274
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,212
Oh, except California law
prohibits taking photos

275
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,131
on private property
without a permit,

276
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:14,358
but you had a permit, right?

277
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,967
- Uh...
- What's that?

278
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,403
Oh, also, extortion can be
prosecuted

279
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:18,428
as a class e felony.

280
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,221
That's four years
in prison easy,

281
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,324
and when you throw in
the murder of Tupac Shakur...

282
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,450
- We didn't do that.
- Yeah, yeah.

283
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,809
You can't pin that on us.

284
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,416
Well, someone's got
to take the fall.

285
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,646
Sorry to bother you.

286
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,815
Forget we were ever here.

287
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,612
That was fun.

288
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,756
Hey, Laura, send those guys
a nice fruit-and-nut basket.

289
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,032
You got it, boss.

290
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,658
Who said you could use
my assistant?

291
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,536
- I did.
- Oh, hello, Mr. Witherspoon.

292
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,347
Did you know the
human head weighs 8 pounds?

293
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,581
Fascinating.

294
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:49,209
So sorry we have
to double up on everything

295
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,212
while we work out who goes
where and who gets fired,

296
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,590
but in the meantime,
help yourself to an intern,

297
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:58,468
one of the rising stars
at our company...

298
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:02,347
- Charlie Witherspoon.
- Hello. I... oh.

299
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:05,642
Sorry, my... my hands
are really sticky.

300
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:10,521
Oh, god, am I blowing this.

301
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,984
Charlie was the editor
of the Harvard lampoon.

302
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,670
He can be Princess Carolyn's
new assistant

303
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:17,737
while I use Laura.

304
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,024
- Ugh.
- Good thinking, boss.

305
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,992
Ah, ah, phone is ringing.
Phone is ringing.

306
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,619
What do I do? What do I do?

307
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:27,330
I'll take it in here,
Charlie. Hello.

308
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,791
Princess Carolyn,
your client is out of control.

309
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,876
Bojack is not my client anymore.

310
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,503
Not bojack. Todd.

311
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,256
I think someone mixed alcohol
into his prop drink.

312
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,799
Oh, you pretenders.

313
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:39,717
Bourbon is the name of a county.

314
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,553
You can't just make bourbon
in Germany.

315
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,597
That would be like
making rice-a-roni

316
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,475
- anywhere but San Francisco.
- No, no, no, no, no.

317
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:50,561
- Ugh. I'll be right there.
- Ow.

318
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,272
You got to get
your shit together.

319
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,108
You are a winner, okay?
You are Todd... hold on.

320
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:58,987
4:30 P.M.
meeting with Eva braun team.

321
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:02,448
Fish.
Okay, you are Todd goddamn...

322
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,450
- What's your last name?
- Chavez.

323
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,327
- Your last name is Chavez?
- Yeah. Why?

324
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,972
I don't know,
I just never thought of you

325
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,497
as a Chavez. Look, I got to go.

326
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:11,433
I feel like you didn't
really finish the pep talk.

327
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,768
I know, but I got a movie
to put together.

328
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:13,835
Best of luck.

329
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,005
Ready for the tagline?
Here's the tagline.

330
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,211
What the heck is going on?

331
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,633
"The woman who loved the man
who hated everyone."

332
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,177
- That writes itself.
- You got to be kidding me.

333
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:26,806
Hey, where were you?
We looked everywhere.

334
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,017
You're having the Eva braun
meeting without me?

335
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,810
I'm so sorry,

336
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,017
but I didn't know what
the protocol was around here,

337
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,897
and these guys were just
chomping at the bit.

338
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,024
- We're just wrapping up.
- But Cate is my client.

339
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,948
Okay, why don't I come
find you when it's over,

340
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,528
and I'll bring you up to speed?

341
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,613
Is that Quentin tarantulino?

342
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,490
Yeah. I brought him on board.

343
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,802
You know he's always wanted
to direct a romantic comedy?

344
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,911
Eva braun
is not a romantic comedy.

345
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,330
Bye.

346
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:56,586
We live in a cynical world,
a cynical world.

347
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,838
He's right, you know.

348
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:02,091
Oh, ooh, oh, oh, over-rotate.
Hey.

349
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,760
I just missed
an important meeting

350
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,030
because I was babysitting
Todd, who's too drunk to work,

351
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:08,348
because you switched out
the prop bourbon

352
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,142
with the real bourbon.
You are ruining my life.

353
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,394
- Have dinner with me tonight.
- No way.

354
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,981
Come on, just me, you,
and a bottle of Pinot.

355
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:18,667
Probably more than one bottle
and some entrees.

356
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,318
And I'll probably get
an appetizer.

357
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,195
I own the restaurant,
so we can go crazy.

358
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,697
- I have to work.
- You don't have to work.

359
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:28,242
- You choose to work.
- Hmm.

360
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,536
Why not choose to be happy
for once?

361
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,626
When you're writing a memoir,

362
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:39,462
you spend a lot of time
reflecting on the past.

363
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,340
I regret not being
a better friend to you

364
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,050
andloven

365
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,343
thank you.

366
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,761
Lover's kind of a weird word,

367
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,429
but thanks.

368
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,556
You want to get out
of this stuffy old restaurant,

369
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,975
get some gelato, and maybe
drive out to the ocean

370
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,354
- and put our feet in the water?
- That sounds great.

371
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,356
Let me just freshen up
my whiskers.

372
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:00,775
Great. I'll get the car
and meet you outside.

373
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,276
You scamper right back, pussycat

374
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,883
you look at your reflection
too long,

375
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,405
you might fall in love.
She's gone.

376
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,450
What do you want, gekko?

377
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,457
Well, I was hoping
to talk to you face-to-face,

378
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,246
but I guess you had
to leave work early.

379
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,081
I left at 8:30. What is it?

380
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:18,501
Well, Cate and I
had a really good talk today.

381
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,378
We have so much in common,

382
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,713
and especially since I'm doing
so much for Eva braun,

383
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,174
it almost seemed weird
that I wasn't repping her.

384
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,510
No. No. No, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

385
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,887
She and I are both
high-powered working mothers,

386
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,306
so I understand her priorities,

387
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,350
so she's switching to gekko.

388
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:37,019
Wow, being a mom
helped my career?

389
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,188
I really can have it all.

390
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,691
This isn't fair.
I know everything about Cate.

391
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,192
Her favorite color is red.

392
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,986
Her favorite book
is suffragette city.

393
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:46,612
Her favorite spice girl is baby.

394
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,281
-I know all I need to know,

395
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,134
which is that she's beautiful,
she's British,

396
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:51,552
and she's gonna make me
a lot of money.

397
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,369
She's Australian, you moron.

398
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,163
If you need me, I'll be at work.

399
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,622
Bye.

400
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,708
Bye.

401
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,046
Uh, telephone.

402
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,590
Charlie, get me Cate blanchett.

403
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:09,051
Um, who is... okay, I don't...

404
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,138
Uh, uh, sorry, I can't...

405
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,682
Oh, sticky.

406
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,517
You know what? Never mind.

407
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,729
If Vanessa gekko wants Cate
that bad, she can have her.

408
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:22,690
I'm gonna be okay.
I'm gonna be happy.

409
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:25,985
Tonight, I choose to be happy.

410
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,529
Hello? I think
I put you on mute.

411
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,656
Good night, Charlie.

412
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:38,372
Holy shit.

413
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,959
Herb! How the hell
are you, buddy?

414
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,794
Ruin any lives lately?

415
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,255
- Excuse me?
- I got your message, asshole.

416
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,592
You got something to say to me,

417
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,594
you come out to Malibu
and say it to my face.

418
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:55,056
I'll be alive tomorrow.
After that, who knows?

419
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,436
Sorry that took me so long.

420
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:03,022
Just wanted to look my best
for you, lover.

421
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:08,486
Hey, I just got kind of
a weird phone call.

422
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:12,406
You and me both.
Hey, screw them all, right?

423
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,742
Yeah.

424
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,327
Are we going to gelato?

425
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,621
Princess Carolyn,
what are we doing?

426
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,748
Getting gelato?

427
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:26,420
This was a mistake.
I been acting crazy.

428
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,382
That phone call just
pulled me back to reality.

429
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,092
You were right.
I don't love you.

430
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,553
You don't love me.
We're just two lonely people

431
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,055
trying to hate ourselves
a little less.

432
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,099
Maybe that's all
we're ever gonna be.

433
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,434
Maybe that's all we ever were.

434
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,896
Well, this night took a turn.

435
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,819
You know the worst part?
I knew this was gonna happen

436
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,572
and I let myself
get excited anyway.

437
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,283
So we agree that this is
on you, then?

438
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,872
I guess I'll see you around.

439
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,125
You're not even
gonna give me a ride home?

440
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:07,211
Sorry, I think I just
need to be alone right now.

441
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,842
Of course, of course.

442
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,595
That's what you get
when you fall for a horse.

443
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,054
Taxi.

444
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,474
You got to get your shit
together.

445
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,661
So yesterday, you let yourself
fall in love a little bit,

446
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,353
and you got your heart broken.

447
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,355
Serves you right
for having feelings.

448
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,150
Starting now, you are
a hard, heartless career gal.

449
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,110
Go to work, be awesome at it,

450
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,197
and don't waste time
on foolish flights of fancy.

451
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,239
From now on, you are a robot.

452
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:37,408
Beep bop boop blurp bleep.

453
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,456
- Hello.
- I want you to know I'm fine.

454
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:44,790
Uh-oh. People only say

455
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,184
they're fine when they're
not fine.

456
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,377
Did I hurt your feelings
last night?

457
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,296
I'm an agent.
I don't have feelings.

458
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,839
Well, I'm glad you called.

459
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,317
I think that you had
the right idea yesterday.

460
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:54,610
I should be
getting back to work.

461
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,177
Can you get me another job?

462
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:58,155
Yeah, well, I'm not
your agent anymore, so, no.

463
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:00,640
Oh, right. Well, just tell
whoever, then.

464
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,141
Haah!

465
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,392
Whoa.

466
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,897
Asshole.

467
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:10,358
Anyway, I'm off to Malibu
to see herb kazaz.

468
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,652
He has cancer, which,
as you know, is a whole thing.

469
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,963
Plus, he hates me, so I could
really use some good news

470
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,530
at the end of the day.

471
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,532
Oh, my god,
you're going to see herb?

472
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,867
You must be really...

473
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:21,314
Nope, don't care.
Not interested.

474
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:24,997
Hope you like kicking ass,
Charlie,

475
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,749
because that's all
we're gonna do today.

476
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,001
My tie got stuck in the
copier this morning.

477
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,503
That's great, Charlie.

478
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,213
If you flip them real quick,

479
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,757
it looks like
the tie is running.

480
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:37,259
Hey, Vanessa, your client,
bojack horseman, wants a job.

481
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,136
- Good luck.
- Oh, yeah, about that.

482
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,805
Gwyneth came in this morning,

483
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,991
and I wanted to show her
that she was a top priority,

484
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,767
so I shredded bojack's contract

485
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,143
right in front of her. Heh heh

486
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,229
what? You just signed bojack
yesterday.

487
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:51,315
I say good riddance
to Mr. Houseman

488
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,109
or whatever
that horse's name is.

489
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,444
It's not like he makes
this company any money,

490
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,406
and he does seem to take up
an awful lot of your time.

491
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,867
I'm from Arizona, Jerry.
I went to Arizona state.

492
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,994
Todd, how do I
turn this thing off?

493
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,371
Todd.

494
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,331
What? I'm busy.

495
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:10,459
Never mind.
Think I've figured it out.

496
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,045
Now that I've got the room
to myself,

497
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,339
time to practice the trombone.

498
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,471
He's kind of in
a bad place right now.

499
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:23,973
We can't just drop him.

500
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,433
The best agent in this building

501
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,017
couldn't get that guy a job.

502
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,245
The best agent in this building

503
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:29,645
got him a job yesterday,

504
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,981
and I could get him a feature
by the end of today.

505
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,566
If you want to get him a movie

506
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,359
by the end of the day,
great, do that.

507
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,445
Otherwise, we are washing
our hands of him.

508
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:41,157
Charlie, I hear nbc picked up
your running tie show.

509
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,200
Congratulations.

510
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,286
Thank you, dad.

511
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:50,166
Hey, Marty,
Princess Carolyn here.

512
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:53,043
How'd you like to work with
the bojack horseman?

513
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,171
What's that? You hate his guts?

514
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,548
What's that?
He's a talentless boob?

515
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,345
What's that? You'll never
work with bojack again?

516
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,053
What's that?

517
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,240
You want him to die in
an ass factory warehouse fire,

518
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,975
smothering to death
under a pile of burning asses?

519
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:09,977
Well, if you change your mind,
give me a call.

520
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,812
Oh, bojack, what am I
gonna do with you?

521
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,564
I don't understand

522
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,625
why you're going through
all this trouble for him.

523
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,651
That guy's dead weight,
Princess Carolyn.

524
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,279
If you don't cut him loose,
you're never gonna be happy.

525
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,031
Help me help you.

526
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:25,034
That's it. Of course.

527
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,077
Cameron crow, you skinny bitch.

528
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,914
You know Jerry Maguire's
my favorite movie of all time?

529
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,665
All your films are so human,

530
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,876
which is super impressive
since you're a crow.

531
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:35,586
Well, my name is Cameron crow,

532
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:37,463
but I'm actually a raven,

533
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,423
so common misconception.

534
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,070
- Well, whatever you are...
- A raven.

535
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,636
- I brought you this
- suffragette city...

536
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,096
"A coming of age story
about rock music,

537
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:50,184
being a teenager in the '80s
and buying zoos"?

538
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:52,019
How have I not
heard of this book?

539
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:53,330
You'd be the perfect director

540
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:54,394
to make a movie out of it,

541
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:55,940
and I happen to know this is

542
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,346
Cate blanchett's favorite book.

543
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,443
I'll bet she'll drop
everything to play the part.

544
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,403
You should give her a caw.

545
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,240
Okay, I see... yeah.
Caw is what crows say.

546
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,826
Again, I am not a crow.

547
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:12,957
Cate, listen to me,
you're making a big mistake.

548
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,251
Eva braun
is your dream, remember?

549
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,503
Cate? Hello?

550
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,505
Cate!

551
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,298
Oh, no. What happened?

552
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,509
Did Cate drop out of
your little holocaust movie

553
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:26,554
so she could make
my little Cameron crow movie?

554
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,514
Why don't you go home
and cry about it

555
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,474
to your loving husband
and children?

556
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,059
Say, which one of you

557
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:34,061
is overseeing
the Eva braun package?

558
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:35,771
That would be me, sir.

559
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,982
Vanessa, you really
shat the bed on this one.

560
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,442
Now, are you fired? Not exactly.

561
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,278
Can you still work here? No.

562
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,946
Lenny turteltaub
here to see you.

563
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:45,781
Thanks, Laura.

564
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:48,009
So, one minute I'm making
a movie with Cate blanchett.

565
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,886
Next, I hear she's doing
a picture with Cameron crow

566
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,078
about mix tapes.

567
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:52,621
As I said to ed Porter

568
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,468
at the premiere of
the great train robbery,

569
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,584
"aah, the train's
coming right at me."

570
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,750
- What the hell is going on?
- I don't know, Lenny.

571
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,379
Eva braun was Vanessa's project.

572
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,006
- All that work for nothing.

573
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:04,174
Now Quentin tarantulino's
got four arms up my ass

574
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,261
'cause he got all excited
about making a rom-com.

575
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,345
You know what would be
a great romantic comedy?

576
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,793
Remember when that guy stole
the d from the Hollywood sign

577
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,808
so he could propose
to his girlfriend?

578
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:14,184
That would make a great movie,

579
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,246
but who would play the lead?

580
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,272
Preferably someone
kind of washed up.

581
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:19,439
You know how much Quentin

582
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:20,792
loves to revitalize
dead careers.

583
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,234
It's kind of his thing.

584
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,361
Well, in that case,
you know who'd be great?

585
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,697
Show me the money.

586
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,035
- Yeah.
- Good news.

587
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,745
You're back in my stable,

588
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,831
and I got you the lead
in a romantic comedy.

589
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:37,833
Who's the best agent
in the world?

590
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,627
What?

591
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,771
I went through hell and back
today, but it was worth it

592
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,965
because I got you a job.
Aren't you excited?

593
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,509
No. I don't know.

594
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,470
I don't care about that.

595
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:52,514
You... you said
you wanted a job.

596
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,100
It doesn't matter.
Nothing matters.

597
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,687
- Wow, what happened in Malibu?
- I got to go.

598
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:02,483
-Need anything else?

599
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:05,986
No, thanks, Laura. Go home.
I'll see you tomorrow.

600
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,488
Are you gonna head out soon?

601
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:10,157
Where else would I go?

602
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:24,171
Happy birthday,
Princess Carolyn.

603
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:27,341
Thanks, phone.

604
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:29,510
You are 40.

605
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,222
J“ we were young j“

606
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:37,184
j“ we had our heads down j”

607
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:39,561
j“ all night j“

608
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:45,234
I I was soul of a landslide j“

609
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:47,403
I didn't know I

610
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:54,535
j“ it was something
to hold on to j“

611
00:24:55,285 --> 00:25:00,416
j“ never meant us to fall in j“

612
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:03,877
j“ turn around j“

613
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,801
j“ turn around j“

614
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,264
boxer versus raptor.

615
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,350
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na!
