1
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:07,841
[Diane]
The series is called "Crooshin' USA."

2
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:08,925
[man] What does that mean?

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,470
Crooshness is hard to define,
but I also don't know it when I see it.

4
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:13,513
Oop. Pardon my reach.

5
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:16,516
Well, I'm always trying to get more girls
interested in agriculture.

6
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:21,062
You might say I've got my eyes on them.
Potato eyes, that is.

7
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,022
-Guy?
-[Guy] Mm-hmm.

8
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:26,735
Hey, girls! It's Diane,
outside Idaho's largest potato supplier,

9
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,236
-Starch Farms.
-Hello!

10
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:29,279
Let me get this straight.

11
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:33,283
Your farm harvests five types of potatoes,
two types of onions,

12
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,869
and is also a front
for a local sex trafficking ring?

13
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:38,997
-[gasps]
-How'd you get started in sex trafficking?

14
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,499
Uh...

15
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,002
[panting]

16
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:46,004
I don't think
I'm getting that microphone back.

17
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,632
This is the second straight year
this Michigan resort's food

18
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,135
has tested positive for avian botulism.

19
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,428
Wow, two years in a row.

20
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:55,638
It's like the Tom Hanks
of poisoning people.

21
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,515
They said the jewelry is safe
for humans now,

22
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:00,560
but I've been wearing this
for a week, and...

23
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:01,478
[groans]

24
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,938
Can we get more B-roll
so we have something to cut away to

25
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,315
when I have to scratch my nose?

26
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:08,151
I thought scratching your nose
was your way of saying hello to me.

27
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:12,655
Don't you find it a little convenient
that the mayor has yet to restore

28
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,115
clean drinking water to this part of--

29
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:18,244
No, it's quite inconvenient.
You think this is convenient?

30
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:21,831
The East Side is a lower-income area,
ergo the residents

31
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,042
are not huge campaign donors, ergo--

32
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,711
No, the mayor
didn't target that neighborhood,

33
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,255
he was just that stupid
when it came to water filtration.

34
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:32,175
He was just stupid enough to think
he wouldn't get caught, ergo--

35
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,719
Say "ergo" one more time.

36
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,679
-Ergo.
-Nah.

37
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,014
-No, no, no, no.
-[Diane giggles]

38
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,224
This is Diane Nguyen...

39
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:40,433
This is Diane... This is Di...

40
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:43,061
This is Diane Nguyen,
and that's the Croosh!

41
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,063
-[Guy mumbles] Let me see.
-Did you hear

42
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,356
about Philip Morris Disney Fox

43
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,401
AT&amp;T AOL Time Warner PepsiCo
Haliburton Skynet Toyota Trader Joe's?

44
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,403
-What about them?
-They got acquired by Whitewhale.

45
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:55,406
Oh, shit.
Well, how many companies are there now?

46
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,825
Four? [gasps]

47
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,535
-What is it?
-I'm sorry, Diane.

48
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,079
Look, I asked for two beds, I swear.

49
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:04,707
-Huh.
-I mean, this is unprofessional. One bed!

50
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,668
What are we supposed to do
with just one bed?

51
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,128
Quite a pickle.

52
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:11,381
I should march right back down
to that front desk and tell them--

53
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,133
[both moaning]

54
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:16,553
Thank you... [chuckles] for helping me
with my one bed bit.

55
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,471
-[both moan]
-It's a good bit.

56
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,557
[theme music playing]

57
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,820
[BoJack's voice] Dear Diane, hello.

58
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,363
-[Guy snores]
-This is a letter.

59
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,782
Rehab is making me write a letter
to a friend

60
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,868
because I guess letter writing
is therapeutic?

61
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,245
I hear it did wonders
for the Zodiac killer.

62
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:28,541
Anyway, rehab's going fine.
A lot of hikes and movie nights and yoga

63
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,461
and I think next week
we're doing a color war.

64
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:35,173
And it's good that I'm here,
and it's good that I'm not drinking

65
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:38,218
or taking pills, but I keep thinking
about how this isn't real life.

66
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:42,597
It's summer camp. Temporary. Easy.

67
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:46,517
As nice as this is, I know that someday
I'll have to go back to the real world.

68
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,811
Hey, Lady, listen, can you put him
on the phone, please?

69
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:52,523
I don't care if he doesn't wanna
talk to me. I'm his father. No, Lady--

70
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,608
[Guy groans angrily]

71
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,193
[BoJack's voice] Anyway, that's my letter.

72
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:58,863
I probably won't even send it,
but if you're reading this, I guess I did?

73
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,907
Your friend, BoJack.

74
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,534
P.S. Horseman.

75
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,498
I'm only in Chicago for a week.

76
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,125
I don't think it's selfish
to wanna see my son.

77
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,127
Yeah, but you gotta give your ex notice.

78
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,504
Whose side are you on?

79
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,714
Uh... Hey, look out the window.

80
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,633
[Guy] Wow, there she is!

81
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:21,594
The second windy, muddy,
big-shoulders city by the lake.

82
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,931
Look! Willis Tower.
Oh, and look, the new Whitewhale building!

83
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:28,059
You cannot be excited
about a giant corporation like Whitewhale

84
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,644
setting up shop in your hometown.

85
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,396
I'm just excited
we got a new big building.

86
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:34,190
-In your face, Dubai.
-[chuckles]

87
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,402
[man gasps and pants]

88
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,488
-Hmm...
-Ah...

89
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,198
-Not bad.
-It's because the bread

90
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,033
is made from lake water and lard.

91
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,452
-[phone buzzes]
-From New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro.

92
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,288
Today, your phone is ringing.

93
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:53,751
Here's what you need to know about people
who still use their phone to call people.

94
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:54,794
Hey, Stefani.

95
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:55,712
Hey, girl!

96
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,839
-No, no, it's Guy.
-[Stefani] Hey, Guy!

97
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:01,009
I got you on speaker. Diane's eating
the best sandwich of her life.

98
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,427
-It's okay.
-[Stefani exhales]

99
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,221
Diane, I love
that you still eat sandwiches.

100
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,433
Flaws like that are what make you
relatable to regular women.

101
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:09,809
-[gulps] What?
-Meanwhile,

102
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:13,646
I am adoring your cross-country exposition
of the ugly underbelly

103
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,023
of American capitalism.

104
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,065
So croosh.

105
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,235
But I wonder if you could make room
in the rotation

106
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,362
for a few feel-good stories?

107
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,323
Stefani, our videos
are making a difference.

108
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,575
Yeah, a difference in how bummed I am.

109
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,119
There's gotta be some good news out there.

110
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,954
-[sighs]
-We'll see what we can do!

111
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,540
-Why'd you say yes?
-We can do feel-good stories.

112
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:34,334
What about that girl who opened up
a lemonade stand

113
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,793
to pay for her dad's cancer treatment?

114
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,420
How is that a feel-good story?

115
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,673
"Hey, America! We're the only developed
nation without subsidized healthcare,

116
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,217
so this child joined
the workforce in a desperate bid

117
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,469
to keep her father alive!"

118
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:45,720
Okay. How 'bout this?

119
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,972
Local cameraman has a pretty
good thing going,

120
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,807
where he gets to travel
all over the country,

121
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:53,227
and fool around in hotel rooms with
his beautiful, smart, feisty producer...

122
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,189
and he's pretty sure
this passionate, intelligent,

123
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,149
warrior for truth likes it, too,

124
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,860
so maybe these two knuckleheads
should swallow their pride for a second

125
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,737
and make some feel-good videos.

126
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:10,495
Hey, girls.

127
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,496
-Hey, Diane.
-Hey.

128
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:14,082
Tell me
about the Every Animal Girl Company.

129
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,751
We are two best friends
who got tired of seeing dolls

130
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:19,420
promoting unrealistic beauty standards.

131
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,421
Take Ginny here.

132
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:23,383
Most giraffe dolls have necks
one inch shorter by scale

133
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,592
than the average girl giraffe.

134
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:25,676
Not our Ginny.

135
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,014
Her neck is long and proud,
for all our necky gals out there.

136
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,974
As a necky gal, I love that.

137
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,936
And is it true that all your dolls
are made out of recycled material?

138
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,604
-Uh... No.
-Yes!

139
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,523
-Sorry?
-Well, traditionally...

140
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,234
-[overlapping dialogue]
-The first batch, um...

141
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:44,028
The important thing is
we're two best friends.

142
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,279
Okay, what's going on?

143
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,240
Uh... [giggles nervously]

144
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,368
Okay. We are excited to announce
that as of today,

145
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:54,288
the Every Animal Girl Company
has been purchased by Toys Galore,

146
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,125
a subsidiary
of Whitewhale Consolidated Interests.

147
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,794
Yay! Toys Galore!

148
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,587
-Uh...
-Huh?

149
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,005
"Yay..."

150
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:06,884
A small, independent start-up
bought out by a huge conglomerate.

151
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,929
It must be so empowering
to see your success grow.

152
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:13,975
What a happy story for two best friends.
Now, about the recycled materials?

153
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:17,687
Well, it's unclear what role recycling
will play in the future of this company.

154
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,982
Right now, we're mainly focused
on empowering young girls,

155
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:24,318
and closing the main Chicago factory
so we can relocate overseas

156
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,611
for cheaper labor.

157
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,988
Right before the holidays!

158
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:29,031
[clears throat] Feel-good.

159
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:32,743
[strained] What an exciting,
empowering time for you!

160
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,412
I know.

161
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,748
You think you can edit that down
into something feel-goody?

162
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,959
For sure.
It'll have to go up late, though,

163
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,545
because I'm having some friends over
to watch the game tonight.

164
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,297
God, I'm freezing.

165
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,550
-Aw.
-So, you, uh...

166
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,636
-You wanna watch the game with us?
-Are you asking me to meet your friends?

167
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,431
No, I just figure,
since you're staying with me anyway--

168
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:56,684
I would be delighted. Wait, it's not
the Chicago Baby Humans game, is it?

169
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:57,685
It's just a mascot.

170
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:01,772
[reporter] And there goes Waa-Waa,
the Baby Human, stumbling around

171
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,108
like the furless featherless dolt he is.

172
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:07,904
What's he got there?
Don't drink that poison, you crazy human!

173
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,990
-We don't drink poison.
-Diane, he's not a literal human.

174
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,826
Waa-Waa is a tribute
to your proud human heritage.

175
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,204
-I'm very flattered.
-Anyway, meet the gang.

176
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,748
Everyone, this is Diane. My, um...

177
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,125
Ah... You know, my--
The woman that I work with.

178
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,502
-[all] Hi.
-[man] 'Sup, dude?

179
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,463
-Hmm...
-You okay?

180
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,924
Yeah. Sorry, just-- I'll be right back.

181
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,968
[doorbell rings]

182
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,061
[sighs]

183
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,063
-Diane, I'm really sorry, but--
-It's fine.

184
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,023
I wasn't expecting, ya know,
in front of your friends.

185
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,900
-He just showed up.
-We haven't put a label on us.

186
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,860
-I'm not looking for--
-The speech and debate tournament

187
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,738
-was canceled on account of cyberbullying.
-Wait, what are you talking about?

188
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,907
-My son is here. He surprised me.
-Oh, shit.

189
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,244
I usually don't bring women around my kid
unless it's serious.

190
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,662
-I get it.
-Do you mind staying at a hotel?

191
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,789
-Oh, yeah. Totally.
-He'll be gone first thing tomorrow.

192
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,457
What if he sees me go out?
Is the coast clear?

193
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,584
-You should maybe go out the window.
-[grunts]

194
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,670
This makes sense. But what about my stuff?

195
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,088
I'll pack your bag
and throw it out to you.

196
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,507
Okay, good. Bye.
Thank you for inviting me to your party.

197
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,466
You have a lovely home.

198
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:14,554
[BoJack's voice] Dear Diane, hello.
I am writing you another letter.

199
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:18,641
Today sucks. There's this new lady here,
Beverly, and she took my snack kit.

200
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:22,770
And that is so classic Beverly.
Probably. I just met her.

201
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,731
The whole point of the snack kits
is they're communal, right?

202
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,900
They're these bags full of snacks
that we take on our morning hikes,

203
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:31,612
and we put them together the night before,
as like a team-building thing.

204
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:36,033
Yesterday, I decided to throw an extra bag
of candied nuts into a snack kit,

205
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,285
something just for me.

206
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,494
And I marked my bag with a "B"

207
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,954
so I'd know which one to grab
in the morning.

208
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:40,955
"B" for "BoJack."

209
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,748
-[groans angrily]
-But then today, I see Beverly,

210
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,167
who, again, just got here,
waltzing around the house

211
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:49,005
with my snack kit, saying, "Oh, somebody
made a special kit just for me!

212
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:52,592
B for Beverly!
I must have a secret admirer!"

213
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,343
Again, just got here!

214
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,803
-[shivering]
-The story of my life

215
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,388
is that I never get anything nice.

216
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,849
You'd think that I'd learn to adjust
my expectations by now.

217
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,517
But, no. Once again,

218
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,604
I was the idiot
who got my hopes up about candied nuts

219
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:08,983
and now I am disappointed
with no one to blame but myself.

220
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,736
-[sighs]
-Anyway, what's new with you?

221
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,614
[scoffs] Just kidding,
you can't say anything, this is a letter!

222
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,116
Okay, talk soon. BoJack.

223
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,165
-[crickets chirping]
-[phone buzzes]

224
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,125
From New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro.

225
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,251
Today, your--

226
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,795
-Hello?
-[Stefani] Diane, your last video--

227
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,340
Okay, I know it wasn't as feel-good
as maybe you wanted--

228
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,008
Are you kidding? I feel great!

229
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,135
You made a big impression with the guys
at Whitewhale.

230
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:39,722
-Really?
-I'll say. They bought Girl Croosh!

231
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,516
-What?
-Well, technically they bought Fuddruckers

232
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,479
and merged it with Dow Chemical to create
a new media venture called Spronk!

233
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,522
-[Diane] Hold on--
-Spronk acquired Univision,

234
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,692
which will incorporate Girl Croosh
into the Gizmodo-branded mist

235
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:52,943
of advertorial.

236
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,404
-That's terrible!
-Not for me! I'm gonna be rich!

237
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,324
-You already are rich!
-Oh, yeah! [giggles]

238
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:02,203
Oops. Well, anyway, good luck with Spronk,
which is currently rebranding

239
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,329
as Content Spew.

240
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,415
So spew that content, girl! [giggles] Bye!

241
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,211
Oh, "spronk" me.

242
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,340
[sputters]

243
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,926
Pardon our dust
while we finish construction.

244
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:20,596
Can I get you a Pepsi Cola?
Or anything else from the vast Whitewhale

245
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,932
agglomeration of fine beverages?
[sputters]

246
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,434
Uh, I think we're good.

247
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,269
Hmm.

248
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:28,854
[beep]

249
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:32,274
-I'm sorry about last night.
-It's fine. Let's just watch the movie.

250
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,528
Welcome!
Here at Whitewhale Consolidated Interests,

251
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:39,907
we do it all through the free-market magic
of the Whitewhale Way!

252
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,410
[both] That's right, Mr. Whitewhale!

253
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,578
Who? Why? Where?
Whence forth are you two,

254
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:49,417
and how did you manifest in my office?
Be gone, ghastly ghouls!

255
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,129
[giggles]
We're no spooky specters! My name's Vert!

256
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,755
Vertical Integration!

257
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,174
And I'm Ollie, the Oligopoly.

258
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:01,846
You summoned us here to tell your new
employees about the Whitewhale Way!

259
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:05,933
Well, best be quick about it,
you unholy apparitions.

260
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:09,478
The Whitewhale Way was developed
by Ezekiel Whitewhale,

261
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:14,483
who started small with a modest petroleum
refinery he inherited from his father.

262
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,486
[Ollie]
One day he looked around and said,

263
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,529
"Wait one minute!

264
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:22,116
While I'm refining this oil, someone else
is getting rich drilling it,

265
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:25,578
and another someone's sellin' it
to the common commuter!"

266
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:28,622
So, he bought his own rig
and opened a chain of gas stations.

267
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:32,001
By controlling both the means
of production and the delivery system,

268
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:35,629
Ezekiel cornered the market,
and choked out the competition

269
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,299
until they had no choice
but to sell to him, too!

270
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:41,343
And that's vertical integration! [burps]

271
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,262
[giggles] Pardon me.

272
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,931
F-f-f-f-fast forward to the 1980s,

273
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:49,435
when Jeremiah took our company
to the next level.

274
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:52,855
[Vert] He bought a telephone company,
a sports team, and when he didn't like

275
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,899
the way the newspapers
were talking about him,

276
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,734
-he bought his own newspaper!
-[Ollie chomps]

277
00:12:56,817 --> 00:13:01,739
Well, I must have been a hungry whale
because I just kept gobbling up companies.

278
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:05,534
Fast forward to today,
and it looks like I gobbled up you!

279
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,537
-[chuckles]
-Are we supposed to be charmed by this?

280
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:15,336
Welcome to the Whitewhale family.
Everywhere you are, that's where we'll be.

281
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,131
Here's a list
of your new sister companies.

282
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:22,802
Please be mindful of them
as you spew your content. [sputters]

283
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,932
So we can't make videos
about any of these subsidiaries?

284
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:31,435
Monsanto, JP Morgan Chase,
Marie Osmond?

285
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,230
Oh! There it is,
the Every Animal Girl Company.

286
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,608
You don't really think Whitewhale bought
Girl Croosh just to kill our video?

287
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:40,027
And you couldn't just tell
a feel-good story about two friends

288
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,278
who started a business.

289
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,905
Maybe this is for the best.

290
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,699
You can get a new job in Chicago,
spend more time with your kid.

291
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,159
Yeah, and you can go back to LA,

292
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,203
where you won't have to borrow my coat
all the time.

293
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:50,746
-[giggles]
-Didn't you wanna write another book?

294
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,873
I have this book of essays
I've been brewing in my head.

295
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,417
It's called, "One Last Thing
and Then I Swear to God I'll Shut Up

296
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,546
About This Forever: Dispatches
from the Frontlines of the War on Women:

297
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:01,549
Arguments, Opinions, Reflections,
Recollections, The Razor Tax--"

298
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,550
Is this still the title?

299
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,885
I kind of got lost in the middle
and couldn't find a way out.

300
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,136
No, no, it's good,

301
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,430
I just think you want to save some of it
for the inside of the book.

302
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,809
[sighs] I guess that's it for us,
though, right?

303
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:16,772
-I guess so. Unless it isn't it for us?
-What do you mean?

304
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,608
What if we did one more video
about anything we wanted

305
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:23,070
and posted it on the website before they
realize we still have all the passwords?

306
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:26,824
-We could do a story about Whitewhale.
-Oh, yeah!

307
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,826
Now, there's a feel-good story.

308
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:32,955
Me feeling good about takin'
those assholes down!

309
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:45,718
Diane, this is Isabel,
star reporter at The Tribune.

310
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,595
She's been hunting Whitewhale for years.

311
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:52,141
-Call me... Isabel.
-Okay.

312
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,435
All my days, the beast has haunted me.

313
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:57,104
The hunt consumes my every waking moment.

314
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:00,024
You might even say Whitewhale is my...

315
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,152
green light at the end of the dock.

316
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,196
-What?
-That's a Gatsby reference. Read a book.

317
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,364
Isabel, be nice.

318
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,326
I wish I had the energy,
but my obsession has ruined me.

319
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:14,788
Destroyed my relationships,
obliterated my career. And for nothing.

320
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:18,459
I had one contact on the warehouse floor,
Matt Minnowman.

321
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,127
-Hmm.
-Then he disappeared.

322
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,463
-Maybe there's your story.
-Not your story?

323
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,675
Mm. My editor thought I was getting
"too invested" in the Whitewhale beat,

324
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,677
so he moved me
to the Holiday Gift Guide desk.

325
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:32,306
Now the search for the season's hot toy
torments my waking days.

326
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:37,269
Are spirographs the new fidget spinners?
The answer eludes me at every turn.

327
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,775
[Diane] I can't believe it. We got a lead.

328
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,361
Hey, do you wanna walk back to my place?

329
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,822
Are you kidding? It's so cold.
How is it snowing in October?

330
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:52,701
There are basically two seasons here:
bitter winter, unbearable humidity.

331
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,828
-You'll learn to love it.
-[giggles]

332
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,372
-[Diane gasping]
-[both giggling]

333
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,041
[BoJack's voice]
Dear Diane, I'm sure you are dying to know

334
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,669
how this Beverly
secret admirer situation is going,

335
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,796
-so I'll cut right to the chase.
-[Guy] Oh!

336
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,383
I started writing "BH" on my snack kits
to clear up any confusion

337
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,676
about who the extra nuts are for.

338
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:13,889
But now Beverly thinks "BH"
stands for "Beverly, here-ya-go."

339
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,642
"Beverly here ya go"?
Why would the "H" stand for--

340
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,061
-[Guy and Diane moan]
-You know what? Doesn't matter.

341
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,939
The dumbest part is that Beverly doesn't
even eat candied nuts.

342
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,148
-[Diane moaning]
-She's allergic.

343
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,775
So she usually just ends up

344
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,151
-giving her nuts to me.
-[Guy snores]

345
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,278
Doctor Champ would probably say
that means something.

346
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,865
That the universe has a way of looking out
for us if we just stop fighting it, but...

347
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,617
I don't know.

348
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,078
Anyway, I guess it's working.

349
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,999
Hope things are working
for you, too. BoJack.

350
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,834
[keyboard clacking]

351
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,128
Were you up all night?

352
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,088
I was following up on this Matt Minnowman.

353
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,841
Turns out there was an "accident"
at the warehouse.

354
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,718
-What?
-He stayed late to finish some work.

355
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,761
"Look at me, I'm just doing some work.
It's no big deal."

356
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,388
Next morning, they found him dead.

357
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,514
Oh, shit.

358
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,434
This guy was trying to get the word out
about working conditions,

359
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,936
and then he died in the warehouse.

360
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,147
I got the names of some coworkers,
let's get our hands

361
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,231
on the security footage.

362
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,233
Did you know your cereal
was made by Whitewhale?

363
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,317
I threw it out to be safe.

364
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,528
Microchips-- Oh, my God,
you're looking at me like I'm crazy.

365
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:12,114
You think I'm obsessed.
Am I totally scaring you off right now?

366
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,074
No. You're glowing.

367
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:15,743
Hmm.

368
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,370
[keyboard clacking]

369
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,915
We were working 17-hour days.

370
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,918
We were spread thinner
than a shitty New York slice of pizza

371
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,087
and working harder than the '96 Bulls.

372
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,674
[Guy] Okay, so Matt's stationed here...

373
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,635
So, what, he walked to the other side
of the room just to die?

374
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,220
That's where he died, all right.

375
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,598
Management left his body out there
on the floor.

376
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,309
Almost like it was a warning
to the other workers.

377
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,643
Wow.

378
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,521
I just don't think you can attribute it
to intentional cruelty.

379
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,315
-It's callousness.
-Can't it be both?

380
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,442
Whitewhale's not evil.
They're just capitalists.

381
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,860
What's the difference?

382
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:52,279
From New York Times,
I'm Michael Barbaro. Today--

383
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,907
-Hello?
-Mister Whitewhale would like to meet you

384
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,785
at the Chicago Whitewhale building
tomorrow at 2:00.

385
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,828
Bring your camera. [sputters]

386
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:04,166
Oh, shit. If they know what we're doing,
why would they wanna talk to us?

387
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,417
I guess we'll find out.

388
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,669
I'm kind of weirdly excited.

389
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,923
-Hey. I got you something.
-What? Shut up!

390
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,467
-Huh.
-Ah.

391
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,219
-You don't like it.
-No, I love it.

392
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:18,472
It's just I won't get much use
out of a coat like this in LA.

393
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:19,681
No. It's for here.

394
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,226
Is this your way of asking me
to move to Chicago?

395
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:27,064
No. [chuckles] Not everything is some kind
of secret underhanded conspiracy.

396
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,817
-Sometimes a coat's just a coat.
-Okay.

397
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:32,861
But I also don't know why it's so obvious
that you go back to LA.

398
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,030
-I live there.
-But there's nothing for you there.

399
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:35,989
Excuse me?

400
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,867
I just don't understand
why you're so into punishing yourself.

401
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:39,785
I am not--

402
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,621
And it's not just yourself,
because every time you get cold,

403
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:46,208
-guess who has to give you his coat.
-Oh, sorry, does that inconvenience you?

404
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,253
No. [sighs] I just don't know
why I should suffer

405
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,922
because you have this ideological
objection to feeling good.

406
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,591
Are you-- I would love to feel good.

407
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:57,344
What a luxury. How nice for you
that you can do that

408
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,929
while the world burns around you.

409
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,682
This is not even about the world,
this is about you and me.

410
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,350
"You and me"?
What's "you and me"?

411
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,394
-Don't--
-No, no, tell me, Guy, please,

412
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,188
because I would love some clarification.
Am I your girlfriend?

413
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,733
Am I the, um,
"you know, woman that I work with"?

414
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,819
-Come on, Diane.
-What is this?

415
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:17,573
I... Just take the coat.

416
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,325
I think I should go back to the hotel.

417
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,661
[sighs]

418
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,423
[Diane shudders]

419
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,926
[birds chirping]

420
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,266
I didn't know if you'd come.

421
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:48,520
Well, we got a job to do, right?
Could get chilly up there.

422
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,526
I don't know what kind of video
you're putting together,

423
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,321
but I wanted to let you know I don't mind.

424
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,739
You're not gonna stop us.

425
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:01,241
I don't want to stop you,
I just said that.

426
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:05,162
See, when you put out stories about us
being "evil" or "callous"

427
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:07,831
or whoever the bad guy in Harry Potter is,

428
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:12,920
people think our business is uncompromised
by morality and our stock goes up.

429
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:16,715
So, it doesn't bother your shareholders
that one of your employees died

430
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,258
in a work-related accident?

431
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,886
-What accident?
-Matt Minnowman's body was found

432
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,137
in your warehouse.

433
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,724
Oh, him, sure!
But that was no accident. I killed him.

434
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,351
-What?
-I murdered him!

435
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,977
Like "murdered" murdered him?

436
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,480
Well, I didn't murder of crows him.

437
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,733
He took too many bathroom breaks
and encouraged the other employees

438
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,485
to take bathroom breaks as well.

439
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:40,072
And you're not worried it's going
to get out that you killed an employee?

440
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,532
Like in the video
we're shooting right now?

441
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:46,954
Didn't you hear? Congress just passed
a bill legalizing murder if you're rich.

442
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,915
-No, they didn't-- Oh, my God, they did!
-What?

443
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,459
Hold on. Just because it passed
the House doesn't mean the Senate will--

444
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:53,543
Really, Diane?

445
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,087
Okay, but the president could still veto--

446
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,338
Really, Diane?

447
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,590
All right, sure, but the Supreme Court.
Okay, I get it.

448
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,550
Look, don't take it so hard.

449
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:05,305
If you wanna do something about it,
just make a billion dollars and murder me!

450
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:06,932
[both cackle]

451
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:10,936
Barbara, let's make sure they get
a nice Whitewhale Company gift bag

452
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,230
-on their way out.
-[sputters]

453
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:19,194
Well, we can still post the video.

454
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,321
Why?

455
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:26,743
Yeah, right, well, um, safe travels.
It's been real.

456
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,663
Yeah. It's been real.

457
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,544
I'm not gonna beg you to stay,
if that's what you're waiting for.

458
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,670
I'm not waiting for anything.

459
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:40,882
I'm not that guy who says, "Diane,
please don't go, I'm in love with you.

460
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,176
Stay here in Chicago
and write your book of essays

461
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,886
and come with me to baseball games.

462
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,889
They've got a pretty good theater scene
here and a big shiny bean and you could...

463
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,349
[sighs]

464
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,727
You could be so happy
in your warm winter coat."

465
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,855
-I don't need you to say--
-I'm not gonna be that guy, all right?

466
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:58,859
But if you wanted to stay, I could
make things so good for you, Diane.

467
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,237
-Listen--
-No, no, I get it.

468
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,531
No, listen. Guy.

469
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:08,577
I feel so shitty all the time.

470
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:14,624
I feel like the whole world is pushing in
on me, except for when I'm with you.

471
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:18,712
You have been such a good thing for me.

472
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:24,509
But I can't be with you
if you're the only good thing in my life.

473
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,054
It's too much pressure. I'm sorry.

474
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,183
-Diane! Don't get on that train!
-[scoffs]

475
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:34,353
-Guy, I just told you--
-I know, but you're going to the airport.

476
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,772
That train's going to Cottage Grove,
you're gonna get screwed!

477
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,690
Oh, no.

478
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:44,279
[BoJack's voice] Dear Diane,
it was Beverly's last day yesterday.

479
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:48,033
Everyone is real excited for her,
but she spent the whole day sulking

480
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:51,161
because she never found out
who her secret admirer was.

481
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:54,247
Frankly, it was getting pretty annoying,
so finally I just say,

482
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,541
"It was me! I'm in love with you!"

483
00:22:56,625 --> 00:23:00,379
And she goes,
"Oh. I was hoping it was Mario."

484
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,589
And then she starts crying.

485
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:07,260
And everyone looks at me like, "Way to go,
you made Beverly cry on her last day".

486
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,472
So, the thing I keep thinking about is...

487
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:14,101
was it worth it for Beverly to be happy
for a little bit,

488
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,186
even though it ended up sad?

489
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:18,522
Or would it have been better
if the whole thing never happened?

490
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,732
Every time someone leaves rehab...

491
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,402
it makes you think
about your own progress.

492
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:26,238
Some days it feels like you're not
progressing at all, other days you think,

493
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,948
"Well, maybe a little."

494
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,866
The main thing I think about
is how stupid I am

495
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,451
that I didn't do this sooner.

496
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:34,788
I wasted so many years being miserable
because I assumed

497
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,706
that was the only way to be.

498
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,042
But I don't wanna do that anymore.

499
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,380
Also, am I crazy or have I gotten
really good at writing letters?

500
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,714
[sighs]

501
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,425
This is BoJack, by the way.

502
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:50,178
-[phone beeps]
-[line ringing]

503
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,973
-Hey.
-Hey.

504
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:56,518
I was thinking about these grilled cheese
sandwiches I used to make,

505
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,145
back when I first moved to LA.

506
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,896
-What?
-I was dirt-broke

507
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,107
and I had no friends and no job,

508
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,735
and I got obsessed with perfecting
the art of the grilled cheese sandwich.

509
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,696
-Makes sense.
-Partly because it was cheap,

510
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,948
but also because while I was doing it,

511
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,409
I wasn't thinking about how depressing
my life was.

512
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:13,452
Okay.

513
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,662
So, on the plane I was thinking,

514
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,789
I should make
another grilled cheese sandwich

515
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:21,251
because I haven't in a long time,
but I love them

516
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:24,296
and they always make me feel better
about things.

517
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,839
-Look, Diane, I gotta--
-And the thing about

518
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:31,219
making your own grilled cheese sandwich
is you can do it anywhere. You know?

519
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,263
Yeah?

520
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:36,349
Yeah.
So, I guess that's another good thing.
