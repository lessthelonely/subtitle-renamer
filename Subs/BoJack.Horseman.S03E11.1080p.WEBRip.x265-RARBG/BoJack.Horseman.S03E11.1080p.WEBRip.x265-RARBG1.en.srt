1
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,184
Good morning, morning.

2
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:23,065
Good morning, sun.
Good morning, trees.

3
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,651
Good morning, busy buzzy bees.

4
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,071
Good morning, Sarah Lynn.
Good to see you, Sarah Lynn.

5
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,281
The tulips and chrysanthemums
are really coming in.

6
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,700
Good morning, handsome garden ants.

7
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:36,036
I like the way you plant my plants.

8
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:40,499
Your flowers make my feelings dance.
I like your handsome planter pants.

9
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,544
Goddamn it!
Why won't you--?

10
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:46,964
It's okay.

11
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,967
Sarah Lynn, you are calm,
you are thin.

12
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,263
Your skin is so soft, it's like you
murdered a baby and stole its skin.

13
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:56,932
Your skin is "murdered-baby" soft.

14
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:58,725
Okay.

15
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,688
Blueberry, goji berry, flax,

16
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:06,525
chia, shark fin, and... white rhino horn.

17
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:15,492
Sober, so good.

18
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,077
Oh.

19
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,037
-BoJack?
-Hey, Sarah Lynn.

20
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:21,957
-You wanna party?
-Oh, thank God. Yes!

21
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:24,561
Okay, hand me the açai.

22
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,104
-Is that how you pronounce it?
-Who knows?

23
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:29,149
They should really just call them
"overpriced blueberries for douchebags."

24
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,567
-Ow.
-How's life?

25
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:34,321
-Well, the truth is that...
-Didn't catch that, but everything's cool?

26
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,198
No. In fact, I've never felt so alone--

27
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,909
Sorry, missed it!
You should learn to talk louder, dude!

28
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,411
Oh, hey, bummer about you
getting the nomination,

29
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,872
but then, it turning out
that you didn't get the nomination.

30
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:44,998
It was big news yesterday.

31
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:47,209
Yeah, I got royally screwed,
know who was there for me?

32
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,587
No one, because everyone's an asshole
and the whole world sucks balls.

33
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,256
-Anyway, thanks for having me over.
-I'm with you, man.

34
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,844
Everything sucks! Especially sobriety.
Why would I make my body a temple?

35
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:00,472
I've been to Temple.
Temple is super boring.

36
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,808
What do you say
we go on an epic bender?

37
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,936
Yes! Let's get higher
than a stilt walker's dick!

38
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,688
That's what I'm talking about.
Let's get some booze and drugs.

39
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:11,358
We can clear out my bank account.
I got nothing left I care about.

40
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,319
What do you mean "get"?
This whole house is booze and drugs.

41
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,279
-Here.
-Yogurt-covered raisins?

42
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:19,116
-Nope. Vicodin-covered Vicodin.
-Oh!

43
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,118
-LSD.
-Wow.

44
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,370
-Yah! Crystal meth.
-Ha-ha!

45
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,622
Ee-yah!

46
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,291
Cocaine-- No! That's drywall.

47
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,877
Ugh! Where the hell
did I hide the cocaine?

48
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,172
Oh, yeah, I also told
the liquor store to deliver.

49
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,717
To nine months of sobriety.

50
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,969
To life and being done with it!

51
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,307
Okay, okay. What about this one?

52
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,351
Remember when Erika Eleniak

53
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,812
guest starred as Goober's cousin
from out of town,

54
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,523
and Brad had a boner
for the whole episode?

55
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:55,068
-What? No.
-You can totally see it in every scene.

56
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:57,279
Cold open, boner! Act one, boner!

57
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:00,824
Commercial break-- "Hello, we're from
the Wheaties corporation!" Back to boners!

58
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,535
Okay, we'll put it on the list.
We gotta watch that one.

59
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:07,080
What about the one where the writers
made Joelle dress up like a pumpkin,

60
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:11,001
and the whole episode was fat jokes,
so then Joelle got an eating disorder?

61
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,711
Everything was so much simpler back then.

62
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,672
She had to go to a clinic.
She missed, like, five episodes.

63
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,424
We didn't know how good we had it.

64
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,010
We got to come to work
and have fun every day,

65
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,804
and we weren't worried
about our legacy or awards.

66
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:26,308
...because buildings are supposed
to be rectangles, goddamn it!

67
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,351
Wait, what were we talking about?

68
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,187
We were talking about <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

69
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,313
Then, you had to go pee.

70
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,315
Then, you came back
covered in toilet paper

71
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,566
and pretended to be a mummy.

72
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,611
Then, you took it all off
because you decided Egypt was stupid,

73
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:38,862
especially pyramids,

74
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:43,116
because you think triangle buildings are,
and I quote, "gauche as shit."

75
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,577
That does sound like me,
but I don't remember any of that.

76
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,163
I must have blacked out.
Maybe I should lay off the alcohol for--

77
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:52,167
...and I said, "You're sitting
on the pizza, Mr. President."

78
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,004
-Whoa! I think I just had another one.
-Another what? Pizza?

79
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:59,508
No, blackout. The thing
we were just talking about.

80
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,551
-Try to keep up here.
-Oh...

81
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,929
Boom! Boner! Pay up!
What did I tell you?

82
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,806
That's not a boner. It's a shadow.

83
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,350
<i>Well, I think we all learned</i>
<i>a valuable lesson today</i>

84
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,143
<i>about the Armenian genocide.</i>

85
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:13,897
<i>The Armenian genocide</i>
<i>was too much, man!</i>

86
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,943
All right! Next episode.

87
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,654
Why can't life be like it was
on <i>Horsin' Around?</i>

88
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:24,241
All our issues conveniently settled
in 22 hilarious minutes.

89
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,494
You know, it's amazing
that it's legal for kids to be actors.

90
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,664
How is that not child labor?
I didn't know what I was signing up for.

91
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,707
-I was three.
-This is getting me depressed.

92
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,836
-Let's do something fun.
-Oh! Okay, you know what really kicks ass?

93
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,212
The planetarium!

94
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,422
You get crazy high in the parking lot,

95
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:43,593
then you go in and get your mind blown
by all the trippy galaxies and shit.

96
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,971
That sounds stupid.
I'm gonna be in charge of the fun.

97
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,889
No, no, no! That was drywall.

98
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:50,141
Jesus, we have to start
marking our drugs more clearly.

99
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:53,270
-Let's just take a box of whiskey and go.
-Whoo!

100
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,522
- It was just so hard.
- Wha--? What the--?

101
00:05:55,605 --> 00:06:00,235
I was stuck in a terrifying cycle
of drinking, lifting my head up,

102
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:04,072
drinking, lifting my head up,
drinking, lifting my head up.

103
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:08,493
Coffee, stale donuts, attention hogs
telling boring stories about themselves?

104
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:11,705
-Jesus! Are we at a 12-step meeting?
-Now, you're a detective?

105
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,624
Last night, you couldn't even solve
the mystery of where the toilet is.

106
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,793
So, all our partying was
an elaborate trick

107
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,003
just to get me to go sober?

108
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,380
No, Detective Pukes
in the Washing Machine.

109
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,841
You're here because I couldn't
leave you alone in my house,

110
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:23,925
and I had to come today.

111
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,302
Gotta get my nine-month chip.

112
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,054
Chip? We've been wasted for...
31 hours?

113
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:29,889
That's no reason for me
to not get my chip.

114
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,434
That's literally exactly the reason
you shouldn't get your chip.

115
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,811
Nowhere in the 12 steps
does it say to not drink.

116
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,606
That's not actually one of the steps.
Loophole.

117
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,441
Take a swig.

118
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,235
If you have to listen to losers talk
about their shitty sober lives,

119
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,112
it's a lot more fun to be buzzed.

120
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:48,116
And I realized people don't change
because they want to change.

121
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,202
They change because they have to change.

122
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,163
Oh, God. Boo!

123
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,749
Oh, booing is generally
frowned upon here.

124
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,501
How else am I supposed to express
how boring these stories are?

125
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:03,214
My name is Simon and I'm an alcoholic.

126
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,758
Hi, Simon.

127
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:10,055
My rock bottom was
when I actually woke up under a rock.

128
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,223
Can't get lower than that.

129
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:14,517
Come on!
You people call yourself drunks?

130
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,479
Most of this is stuff I do
on a daily basis completely sober.

131
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,940
Trust me, pal,
we've done some awful things.

132
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,983
One time, I didn't want
my friend to move out,

133
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:26,529
so I used character actress Ann Dowd
to help me sabotage his hip-hopera.

134
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,031
Oh, please, that's baby stuff.

135
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,242
You so-called drunks want
something to feel shitty about?

136
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:34,371
-BoJack, maybe we should go.
-I got somethin' for ya. Whoa.

137
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,789
My name is BoJack.

138
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,374
Hi, BoJack.

139
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,917
Oh, like you didn't know?

140
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,545
Anyway, I once went all the way down
to New Mexico to see a woman that I knew,

141
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,464
and she had a young daughter, Penny.

142
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:47,342
Penny Carson. That's her real name.
You can look her up. I don't care.

143
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,220
And first, I tried to sleep
with the mom, but she said no.

144
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,263
Then, I tried to sleep with the daughter.

145
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,975
Then, the mom walked in on me
trying to sleep with the daughter,

146
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:58,311
and I was like,
"Oopsie-doopsie! Exit stage right!"

147
00:07:58,395 --> 00:07:59,437
Oh, God.

148
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:02,357
The worst part is, I don't even know
what happened after I left.

149
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,735
Did I ruin the family?
Did I scar that little girl for life?

150
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,195
I don't know. I'll never know.

151
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,572
And that's just, like,
one of a billion things

152
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,200
that I have going through my head
all the time.

153
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,160
So, anyone got a better story than that?

154
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:15,453
Wow.

155
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:16,997
Didn't think so, bitches.

156
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,832
Where's my trophy, or chip,
or whatever?

157
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:21,793
Whoa!

158
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,338
That was impressive, BoJack.

159
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:29,050
I've never seen them cancel an AA meeting
because everyone got bummed out before.

160
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,176
Uh, what are you talking about?

161
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,554
You told everyone about that Penny chick.

162
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,556
Then, you went on and on
about how you're never going to change.

163
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,392
Then, you chased the slug around,
threatening to pour salt on his head.

164
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:41,104
-I talked about Penny?
-Hey! We've all done shitty stuff before.

165
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,607
Most of us aren't as proud of it
as you seem to be.

166
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:48,778
I'm not proud. I feel really terrible that
I might have really messed that girl up.

167
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,239
Oh, she's fine.
I looked her up on Facebook.

168
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,323
She's going to Oberlin,

169
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:56,494
likes Thai food and the smell of a fire
on the first really cold day of winter.

170
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:58,371
That doesn't mean anything.
Everyone likes the smell of fire

171
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,456
on the first cold day of winter.

172
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,959
You know, I used to feel just like you
before I got into this "12 steps" thing.

173
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,502
They taught me how to make amends.

174
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,463
You just say you're sorry
for the things you did

175
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,797
and you get a clean slate.

176
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:11,509
-So, what? Just dirty up the slate again.
-Then, you just make amends again.

177
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:12,927
It's a never-ending cycle,

178
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,597
where you always end up
feeling good about yourself.

179
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,806
- No!
- You know what?

180
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,225
This may be the nitrous
and bath salts talking,

181
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,227
but I want to do some more
nitrous and bath salts.

182
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,230
And then, let's make
some goddamn amends.

183
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:28,068
Maybe you should start with the family
whose playhouse you just smashed.

184
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,652
- Oh, no!
- Oh. Hey, kid!

185
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,655
I'm sorry your lame dad built
such a cheap-ass playhouse!

186
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:36,743
Yeah, you gotta use parallel joints
to support that foundation, dumbshit!

187
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:40,246
-Also, suck a dick!
-You know what? I do feel better.

188
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,421
-I don't think they're home.
-So, we wait.

189
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,757
I need to make amends to Diane,
and we're not leaving until I do.

190
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,470
But it's boring out here,
and I'm hungry and I'm bored!

191
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,971
I bet they have food inside.

192
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,682
Let's see if I still have
that spare key. Here it is.

193
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:00,934
Yes!

194
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,143
Okay, after we get food,

195
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,854
remind me that this is another thing
I need to make amends for.

196
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,608
Where are those two?

197
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,568
They did not keep their fridge
stocked enough

198
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,612
for two stoned people
waiting around for hours.

199
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,824
It's only been, like, ten minutes.
You have a real thing with food.

200
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,159
That's what happens when you mix
the appetite of a horse

201
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,078
with the appetite of someone
with a hole inside him

202
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,622
that needs to be constantly filled
with attention, food, and sex.

203
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,125
-Pass the Bugles.
-There's no more Bugles.

204
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,960
There's no more of anything.
Let's just go.

205
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:31,339
- I can't leave until I make amends.
- I got a idea!

206
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:35,677
My name is BoJack's friend What's-Her-Face
and I wear glasses.

207
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,595
Do you have something
to say to me, BoJack?

208
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,849
-Am I BoJack or Mr. Peanutbutter?
-You can be anyone you want.

209
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:44,018
This is your dream... dream... dream...

210
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:46,980
Stop doing that. We're both awake.
Let's just get to this.

211
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,274
Diane, I'm sorry
I said mean things to you.

212
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,902
That's cool. I forgive you.
Wait, would my character say that?

213
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,864
What's Diane's deal again?
She's, like, an Asian Daria?

214
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:59,784
-She's a little more complex.
-But she's basically Asian Daria, right?

215
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:03,329
With the glasses and the jacket
and her whole "blah" thing.

216
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,582
Okay, shut up.
Now, I'll be Mr. Peanutbutter

217
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,916
and you make amends to me.

218
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,334
Who's Mr. Peanutbutter?

219
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:11,171
And, now, you be Mr. Carolyn
and I'll be Princess Diana.

220
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,339
Oh, yeah. Good idea.

221
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:16,259
Um... should we do something about this?

222
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:20,471
Hey, why don't you two
sleep this off in our guest room?

223
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,348
Oh, my God, that mirror is talking to us!

224
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,601
You can't stop us, us from the future!

225
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,769
We're making amends, assholes!

226
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,689
Ow! Come on!

227
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,276
-That felt so good!
-See?

228
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,695
When you make amends,
don't you just feel lighter?

229
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,697
Well, I also ate
a shit ton of Bugles, so no.

230
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,617
But I do feel like we got to the bottom
of who really killed Princess Di.

231
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,786
-It was all of us.
-Next stop, Todd!

232
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:47,957
Todd, I'm sorry. I want to take
full responsibility for what happened,

233
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,960
even though it is not my fault
and I did nothing wrong.

234
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,546
Emily is an adult woman
who can make her own choices.

235
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,882
And besides,
are you even really into girls?

236
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,092
-I mean, what is your deal?
-Uh...

237
00:11:58,176 --> 00:11:59,802
-Hey, what are you doing with our son?
-Uh...

238
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,095
Wait, you're BoJack Horseman.

239
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:04,641
I am, and this is
my best buddy Todd.

240
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,685
That movie star has really
taken a shine to our boy.

241
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:08,937
You think this is our big break?

242
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,065
You don't think he's inappropriately
interested, do you?

243
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,109
What? No. But if he is,
that could also be a big break.

244
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:16,194
I'm just saying.

245
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,364
-Hey, wait!
-Hold on. Where are you going?

246
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,783
-Come back.
-You want to take Todd for a sleepover?

247
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,117
-Sleepover?
-No offense, Todd,

248
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,619
but your parents are creeping me out.

249
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,412
To the next amends!

250
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,252
-What do you want, BoJack?
-I don't know.

251
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,088
I'm very drunk and a little nauseous,

252
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,924
but if I'm here in your house,
it must be to make amends.

253
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,426
-Amends... for what?
-I don't know.

254
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,804
Whatever it is that you think I did
to make you disappear.

255
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,389
-BoJack--
-How could you leave me like that

256
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,473
when I needed you most?

257
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:48,935
I'm sorry, BoJack. I thought
you were a winner. I was wrong.

258
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,521
This is hard for me, too.
I staked my reputation--

259
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,981
No, this is not about the Oscar campaign.

260
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:55,024
How could you think
that this is about the Oscar campaign?

261
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,651
We had something more, didn't we?

262
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,320
-You've been drinking.
-Well, not just drinking.

263
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:02,031
Yes, Ana, I'm a mess.

264
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:05,284
Whoa! I am a broken,
screwed-up misfit toy,

265
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,787
and you act all in control,

266
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,832
but I know that, deep down,
you're broken, too.

267
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:15,169
And I don't know why you won't just
give us a chance to be broken together.

268
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,879
What about that doesn't appeal to you?

269
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:23,720
BoJack, when I was in college,
I had a job as a lifeguard...

270
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,390
Wait, did we just go to Ana's house?
Did I get closure?

271
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,768
If by "closure" you mean
I lit her ottoman on fire, then yes.

272
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,020
We gotta go back.

273
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,063
-What the hell?
-I know I was just here,

274
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,190
but I feel like you told me
some important story

275
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:37,817
that explained everything about us.

276
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,403
Unfortunately, I totally spaced it.

277
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,238
Gotta be honest.
I've had a couple beers.

278
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:46,534
Ugh! All right, I'll tell you again,
if it'll make you leave.

279
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,327
When I was a lifeguard, I...

280
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:51,414
-Oh, crud.
-You want to go back to Ana's, don't you?

281
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,875
I feel like I'll definitely
get it this time.

282
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,668
Lifeguard...

283
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,671
-One more time?
-No. This time I wrote it down.

284
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:03,134
"I'm a lifeguard. This woman's house
smells weird, or is that me?

285
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,469
Pay attention, Sarah Lynn.

286
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,596
Don't do that thing
where you write down your thoughts

287
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,639
instead of what the person
is actually saying.

288
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:11,392
I wonder if it's time to get
my boobs done again."

289
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,019
- Mm-hmm.
- That's very helpful.

290
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,270
Thank you. Who's next?

291
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,272
I'm sorry!

292
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,900
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

293
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:22,487
I'm sorry!

294
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,622
Okay, so I know
I keep bothering you tonight.

295
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,416
Tonight? I haven't seen you
in two weeks.

296
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,334
Oh, really?

297
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,462
I just need to know what you were
trying to tell me about being a lifeguard,

298
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,714
and then, I'll leave
and you'll never see me again.

299
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,257
Mmm...

300
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:47,345
After I almost drowned, I decided
I would never again be weaker than water.

301
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,430
So, I became a lifeguard.

302
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:52,225
On my first day of training,
my instructor told me

303
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:56,187
that there are going to be times
when you'll see someone in trouble.

304
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,482
You're going to want to rush in there
and do whatever you can to save them,

305
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,151
but you have to stop yourself,

306
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:05,446
because there are some people
you can't save.

307
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,032
'Cause those people
will thrash and struggle

308
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:11,494
and try to take you down with them.

309
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,373
What does that have to do with me?

310
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,709
What the--?
Where the hell are we now?

311
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,002
-Ohi--
-Ojai?

312
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,672
-We drove all the way to Ojai?
-Let me finish.

313
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,758
Ohi, and here's the kicker... O.

314
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:28,594
-Ohio.
-We drove all the way to Ohio?!

315
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:32,140
I wanted to go to the planetarium,
but you demanded we come here.

316
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:36,060
You said you had to make
one more amend, to that Penny girl.

317
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,937
What? No! That is a terrible idea.

318
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,856
Let's turn this car around right now.

319
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,399
Uh...

320
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,776
-I feel we didn't turn the car around.
-No, we did,

321
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,653
but then, you turned it back around

322
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,197
because you really wanted
to find that deer girl,

323
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,199
so we decided to do a stakeout.

324
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,869
There was a whole makeover sequence,
where we went to the mall

325
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,620
and tried on different trench coats
for each other.

326
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,581
Do you not remember any of that?

327
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,333
This is insane.
I already scarred her for life.

328
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:02,336
If I see her again, I'll just end up
getting my horribleness all over her.

329
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,464
You think it's too late for me
to go to college?

330
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,007
I always wanted to be an architect.

331
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,383
But one of those architects,

332
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,552
where, at night,
she's a high-end call girl,

333
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,221
and, by day,
she's an international superspy.

334
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:15,475
-So, when is she an architect?
-I don't know. Frontier times?

335
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:16,934
No, I didn't mean what era.

336
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:19,562
If she's a call girl at night
and a spy during the day--

337
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,231
-Hey, look, Penny.
-Oh, God, what's she doing?

338
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,650
-Does she look emotionally damaged?
-She's just going to the computer.

339
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:27,528
She's probably in a sex chat room
with some middle-aged horse

340
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:30,323
because that's the only way
she can still feel love.

341
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,826
-Yeah, probably.
-Or she's so upset about what you did

342
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,746
that she's using the Internet
to find ways to commit suicide.

343
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:37,830
That makes even more sense.

344
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,750
All right, we've established
that you ruined her.

345
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,252
-Can we go back to L.A. now?
-Yes.

346
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:46,964
So... obviously, I wanted to keep
following Penny because I'm an idiot.

347
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,508
Let's just nip this in the bud.

348
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,135
I'm gonna write "Do not follow Penny"
on my hands

349
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:53,763
in the unlikely scenario
of my blacking out again.

350
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,390
I'll just write "Follow Penny"
on this hand,

351
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:57,975
and then, on this hand, I'll write...

352
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,353
-Goddamn it!
-What?

353
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,271
We're just doing what the hand said.

354
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,068
-Uh, what?
-The hand demanded donuts.

355
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,445
- There she is.
- She's drinking beer.

356
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,614
Oh, God, this is just like
the episode of <i>Horsin' Around</i>

357
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,157
when Olivia went to the frat party,

358
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:16,118
but Penny doesn't have a kind angel
played by Jose Canseco

359
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,745
to help her get out of this jam!

360
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,706
Ugh. Okay, now, I'm bored again.
Quit hoggin' the 'nocs.

361
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,793
She's just drinking Red Bull.
Wait. Now, she's leaving.

362
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,379
Hey, look, it's the Obertones!

363
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,005
Love your sound, dudes!

364
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,131
<i>-♪ Thank you ♪</i>
<i>-♪ Thank you ♪</i>

365
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,342
<i>-♪ Thank you ♪</i>
<i>-♪ Thank you! ♪</i>

366
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,886
She seems... fine.

367
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,557
Too fine, like she's hiding a dark secret
that's eating away at her soul.

368
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,268
Or, possibly... she's fine.

369
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,978
Maybe I didn't ruin her life.

370
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,855
Hey, you were a father figure,
who was sexually inappropriate to me,

371
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,148
and I turned out perfect.

372
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,442
-Now, can we please go home?
-Okay, good plan.

373
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:52,655
I'll just go pee out the last 20 beers.
Whoa. Look at me, walking good.

374
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

375
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,493
No, no, no! Shush, shush.

376
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,579
-BoJack?
-Oh!

377
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:02,081
-What are you doing here?
-Hey, Penny!

378
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:05,334
-Did you come here to find me?
-No, I--

379
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:08,588
You can't be here.
I-I don't want to see you here.

380
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:12,466
I don't want to see you at all.
I was 17. I didn't know any better.

381
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,884
-I tried--
-You need to leave.

382
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:16,262
It's BoJack Horseman and Sarah Lynn!

383
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,723
-Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
-BoJack, we need to get out of here now.

384
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:22,184
Can I get a selfie and another selfie
if the first selfie doesn't look good?

385
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,937
BoJack, over here!

386
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,230
Penny, no.

387
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:27,898
Penny?

388
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,613
You know, on the plus side,
she really seemed okay.

389
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:34,530
Mm-hmm.

390
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,741
Until she saw you and freaked out.

391
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,994
But she probably would have been
totally fine if you'd never shown up.

392
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:43,289
-Oh, God.
-I think the wound was completely healed

393
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,417
before you reopened it by showing up
unannounced at her college

394
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,294
and all the pain came
rushing back to her.

395
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,295
Oh, good Lord!

396
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,714
In a way, it's like
you destroyed her life twice.

397
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,592
-Will you please stop talking about it?
-Okay, fine.

398
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,594
Whoop.

399
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,763
Man, Ohio sucks!

400
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,891
Next time, could you almost molest
someone who lives in Hawaii?

401
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,435
You could be bummed out
at a luau right now.

402
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:05,770
Let's just go home.

403
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,772
-You got a bottle opener?
-Glove compartment.

404
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:12,276
Well, I'll be a dick sucked by a dumbshit!
What do we have here?

405
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,029
Oh, that? Turns out there's
a brand of heroin called BoJack.

406
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,573
Dude, that's a big freaking deal.

407
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,660
Getting a drug named after you
is cooler than getting an Oscar.

408
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:23,245
I mean, there's Billy Crystal Meth,
Angel Dustin Hoffman,

409
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,997
Lucille Eightball and now you.

410
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,917
It's a rarefied breed, man.
Congratulations!

411
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,169
-Thank you?
-Oh, we have to do BoJack!

412
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,129
-It's too perfect.
-I don't know.

413
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,632
There's that old saying.
"Liquor before beer, never fear.

414
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:35,841
Don't do heroin."

415
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:38,511
"I'm BoJack.
Please, put me inside you."

416
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,055
I'm not gonna shoot heroin
with you, Sarah Lynn.

417
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,808
We can snort heroin
like sophisticated adults.

418
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,226
Way ahead of you.

419
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:56,487
Okay, thank you.
Happy Thanksgiving 2007.

420
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,364
Why did you just say what year it is?

421
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,409
I guess I just get nervous
talking to network executives.

422
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:04,495
This last episode got
the worst ratings yet.

423
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:08,040
I was afraid your character trying heroin
would be a bridge too far.

424
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,626
-Oh.
-And the disjointed blackout structure,

425
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,921
with the one flashback in the middle,
really confused our audience.

426
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:14,839
Yeah.

427
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,550
They hated all
the fourth-wall-breaking meta jokes.

428
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:21,470
Of course. Audiences hate meta jokes.
When will comedy writers learn?

429
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,140
BoJack, I know there is an audience
out there for our show.

430
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,518
We just need to find a way
to get more people to check us out.

431
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,311
I know what you're thinking--
Full frontal.

432
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,647
I was thinking guest star.

433
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:34,567
We need a celebrity who
is incredibly popular right now, like--

434
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,611
-Oh, what about Sarah Lynn?
-Ooh, that's genius!

435
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:40,573
Sarah Lynn? I don't know.
I haven't spoken to her in years.

436
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,742
Besides, she's not gonna
want to do this.

437
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,785
She's the world's biggest pop star.

438
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:47,121
She's the only hope we have
to keep this show alive.

439
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,290
Would you ask her?
I'm sure she'd do it for you.

440
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,542
You're like a father to her.

441
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,341
-So, what is it?
-What is what?

442
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:02,303
You were mumbling about
how you had to ask me something.

443
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:06,348
Oh! Um, never mind. Hey, how long
have we known each other?

444
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:09,977
-Feels like our entire lives.
-Well, my entire life, pretty much.

445
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,730
We were on a TV show.
Isn't that insane?

446
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,273
Yeah, it's pretty wild.

447
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:17,359
You know, sometimes it feels like you're
the only one who really understands me,

448
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,028
because how could anyone else?

449
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:22,239
Nobody knows what we went through,
nobody who wasn't on that show.

450
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:24,909
But we knew each other
before we were anybody,

451
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:28,329
and that's how we can be friends,
because we're not like those other people.

452
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:31,165
The people who glom onto you
because of who they think you are,

453
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,709
and they think they can sleep
on your couch and eat your food.

454
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,294
They think you're gonna
save their agency.

455
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,338
I never asked for that kind of pressure,

456
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,591
but you and me, we don't want
anything from each other.

457
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,886
You know, I... I could never
figure out what love meant,

458
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,639
but, right now, I don't need
to figure out anything.

459
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:50,476
I just feel it.
I love you, Sarah Lynn.

460
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,853
Sarah Lynn?

461
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:54,814
-Sarah Lynn?
-What?

462
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:58,067
-Oh, my God! Thank God you're okay!
-I'm not okay. I'm bored.

463
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,985
This hotel room is boring!

464
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:01,237
What's on TV?

465
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:05,407
- The Oscars are on.
- Really?

466
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:08,953
-How long have we been on this bender?
-I love the Oscars.

467
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,163
The red carpet, the fashion,

468
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:14,750
all the magic of Hollywoo
wrapped up in one exciting night.

469
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,670
<i>And the winner</i>
<i>for Best Original Song is...</i>

470
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,297
<i>"The Silly Banana Song"</i>

471
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,716
<i>from</i> The Nazi Who Played Yahtzee
<i>by Sarah Lynn.</i>

472
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,593
<i>Get your ass up here, girl.</i>

473
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:29,515
I won! Oh, my God!
I forgot I was even nominated.

474
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:32,518
<i>I accept this on her behalf.</i>

475
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,187
<i>And if you're watching this,</i>
<i>Sarah Lynn,</i>

476
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:38,357
<i>wherever you are,</i>
<i>please come home.</i>

477
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:44,446
Oh, man, I should have been there.

478
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,701
When I was a kid,
if you'd told me I'd win an Oscar,

479
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,536
I'd never have believed it.

480
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,913
And, now, I've done it and...

481
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:58,085
BoJack... I don't...

482
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:00,504
like anything about me.

483
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:02,339
-Hey.
-None of this is me.

484
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:04,008
These boobs aren't me.

485
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,802
-This house isn't me.
-We're not at your house right now.

486
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,554
The only reason I wear this shirt

487
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:11,932
is because some company
paid me $8,000 to wear it.

488
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:14,018
And I don't even need the money.

489
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:17,313
I just liked that someone
still wanted me to wear their shirt.

490
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,898
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

491
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:22,818
What am I supposed to do?
I don't know what to do.

492
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,738
Am I doomed? Are you doomed?
Are we all doomed?

493
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,324
No, no! Calm down. Nobody is doomed.

494
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,785
And I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
We're gonna go to the planetarium.

495
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,454
Really?

496
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,917
<i>Our solar system formed</i>
<i>about four and a half billion years ago...</i>

497
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:41,503
-Isn't this place amazing?
-Totally.

498
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:44,089
I always forget that there are
more than just the six stars

499
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:45,716
you can see in the Los Angeles sky.

500
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,260
Yeah, that's cool, too,
but I meant this building.

501
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:51,305
It's a giant dome.
Domes are so cool.

502
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:54,475
I prefer rectangular buildings,
as I firmly established.

503
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:58,228
I wanna be an architect.

504
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:02,107
<i> ...be it horse, cat, human,</i>
<i>or even lizard,</i>

505
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:04,693
<i>our lives are but the briefest flashes</i>

506
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:08,364
<i>in a universe</i>
<i>that is billions of years old.</i>

507
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,658
See, Sarah Lynn, we're not doomed.

508
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:14,411
In the great grand scheme of things,
we're just tiny specks

509
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:16,413
that will one day be forgotten.

510
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:20,042
So, it doesn't matter what we did
in the past, or how we'll be remembered.

511
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,671
The only thing that matters
is right now, this moment,

512
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:27,299
this one spectacular moment
we are sharing together.

513
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:28,717
Right, Sarah Lynn?

514
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:31,804
