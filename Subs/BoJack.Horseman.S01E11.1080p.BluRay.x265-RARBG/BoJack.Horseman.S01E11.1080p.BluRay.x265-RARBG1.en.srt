1
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:14,096
Whoa!

2
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,183
Okay, how about this one?

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,894
Bojack swallowed a dozen
pastries in the time it took

4
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:20,562
the caterer
to unwrap a fruit tray.

5
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,731
When she asked where
the pastries had gone,

6
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:24,775
bojack claimed he had no idea,

7
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:27,194
spraying her with
bits of buttery crust?

8
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,821
I did that once.

9
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:31,907
Oh, but with holiday cookies.

10
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:34,034
I had sprinkles
all over my sweater.

11
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,953
See? People respond

12
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,913
to the flawed portrait
I painted of you.

13
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,790
They see themselves in it.

14
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:41,166
Why do you love secretariat?

15
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,584
Uh, because he was awesome?

16
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,461
No, because he was flawed.

17
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:46,672
Bojack, when people find
out that someone like you,

18
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:49,883
who seems larger than life,
is actually just as wounded

19
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,011
and vulnerable as they are,
it makes them feel less lonely.

20
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,389
Ugh, no!
Maybe that's what flawed,

21
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,391
sad fatties want
from other celebrities,

22
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,142
but for bojack horseman,

23
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,687
they want a heroic horse-stud
who is awesome

24
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,565
and who can save them from
their flawed, sad, fatty lives.

25
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,491
- You're so wrong.
- Actually, you know what?

26
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,767
Now that I think about it,
I think that you're so wrong!

27
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:12,030
Listen, we all agree
Diane broke contract

28
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,074
by leaking
the first two chapters,

29
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,535
but the response
has been amazing!

30
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:18,704
People want to read more,
and we have to

31
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,750
get this to the printers
by the end of the week,

32
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,594
because that's when
the repo men are coming

33
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,001
to take away our printers.

34
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,419
The end of the week? No!

35
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,254
Okay, what if I told you
that I could have

36
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:28,547
a new book for you by then?

37
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:31,174
- What?
- Yeah, a better one.

38
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,176
Better stories,
better told, by me...

39
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,803
Straight from the horse's mouth.

40
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,180
You're gonna write
a whole book in five days?

41
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,987
When's the last time
you even read a book?

42
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:40,392
"The firm," by John Grisham?

43
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:43,228
0h, do you think
what you do is so hard?

44
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:45,355
"Oh, I'm a writer.

45
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:48,317
"I go to coffee shops
with my laptop and my notebook

46
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,944
"and my dumb glasses
that I have to wear,

47
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,947
because I'm so important
I need to see clearly."

48
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,434
Well, I wish you
the best of luck.

49
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,867
You know what your problem is?

50
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,914
You think you're so much
smarter than everybody.

51
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,036
Well, guess what.

52
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,789
I spent as much time with you
as you did with me.

53
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,435
Why don't I write a book about
how you married Mr. Peanutbutter

54
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,670
because he's too dumb to see how
much better you think you are?

55
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,048
- Okay, I know you're upset...
- I'm not upset.

56
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,967
I'm just sick of nerd-girls like
you beating up on stars like me.

57
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,511
It's pathetic!
I'm sorry no one wanted

58
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,597
to date you
in high school, Diane,

59
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,658
but I don't see why I have
to suffer just because

60
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,769
you were never especially
pretty or interesting.

61
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,937
You really let me down, bojack.

62
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,773
You really let me down.

63
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,317
I apologize for her outbursts.

64
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,737
So, you really think you could
write a better book by Friday?

65
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:36,156
Damn right I can, so you
can throw this turd of a book

66
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,533
in the garbage and then
light the garbage on fire.

67
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,244
In fact, you can burn all books,
because my book,

68
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,581
written by me,
is gonna kick your dick off.

69
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:44,307
Okay, chapter one.

70
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,435
Hmm.

71
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,478
Not quite right.

72
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:53,275
Huh.

73
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:54,525
What?

74
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,486
Why are you rewriting
the book, bozo?

75
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,280
Diane's version is great.

76
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,282
You're gonna lose
gems like this one...

77
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,832
Ahem. "The only
longstanding relationship

78
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:12,294
"in bojack's life is with
his agent, Princess Carolyn.

79
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,588
"Her loyalty must come
from a deep-rooted faith

80
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,507
"that she's talented enough
to sustain the career of a man

81
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,676
society perceives as a joke."

82
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,387
Uh, yeah, I would say that
I'm not such a fan of that one.

83
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,222
Look, all publicity
is good publicity.

84
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,784
That guy who killed all those
teachers and ate their fingers?

85
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,227
He just got married in jail,
and when this book comes out,

86
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,479
you could be that guy.

87
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,230
Oh, don't you get it?

88
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,417
This is my last chance
to make people love me again.

89
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,481
If this goes out, everybody's
gonna see the real me.

90
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,528
Now, I spend a lot of time
with the real me,

91
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,614
and believe me,
nobody's gonna love that guy.

92
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,157
- Okay.
- Now if you'll excuse me,

93
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:43,364
I need to go take a shower

94
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,202
so I can't tell
if I'm crying or not.

95
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,582
All right, let's get to work.

96
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,544
I feel like we can
beat this font.

97
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:58,757
Ah, copperplate, a font
for the truly modern man.

98
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,008
Ha. No.

99
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,843
There you are, verdana.

100
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,238
Thought you could hide at the
end of the alphabet, did ya?

101
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:07,057
Oh, comic sans,
you drunk, go home.

102
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,100
3:10? I just spent six hours

103
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,061
playing with fonts? Holy shit!

104
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:12,604
Okay, focus bojack, focus.

105
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:15,273
Here comes the focus.

106
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,363
Well, this can't be that hard.

107
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,174
Bojack often felt the need

108
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,492
to impress me
with material items.

109
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,661
You can see from the
teeny, tiny brush strokes,

110
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,871
that this is very expensive.

111
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,833
The color is, um... this one they
don't even have a name for,

112
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,519
that's how exclusive it is,
and this...

113
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:35,978
I wondered where this came from.

114
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,629
There were two obvious suspects:

115
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,130
His mother Beatrice,

116
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,216
heiress to the sugarman
sugar cubes fortune

117
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,218
and used to certain comforts,

118
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,804
and his working-class father,
butterscotch horseman,

119
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:48,640
who struggled, and often failed,
to provide those comforts.

120
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:50,600
Or, maybe it was
something even...

121
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,146
Puuuhhhh!

122
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,152
Puuuhhhh!

123
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,676
- Hey, Todd, Todd!
- What? What?

124
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,993
- Todd! Todd!
- What? What?

125
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,870
Eyeballs here... look at me.
Look at me!

126
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,955
I need to work.
I can't afford to be distracted.

127
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:15,250
- Don't distract me.
- Fine.

128
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,961
Oh, Jesus, Todd!

129
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,463
- Read louder much?
- Sorry.

130
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,759
Oh, sure, just drop
toaster strudel crumbs

131
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,511
all over the floor,
why don't you?

132
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:30,348
Guess I'll just clean them up
myself, like always.

133
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,435
Oh, I can't work like this.

134
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,858
Come on, come on, come on,
pick it up, you dumb vacuum.

135
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,055
Oh, I do not have time for this.

136
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,653
I need to write.

137
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:48,658
What the... come on!

138
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,952
Seriously?
You cannot be seriou...

139
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:54,539
God, why are you keeping me
from writing?

140
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,380
J“ doot j“

141
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,257
j“ doot j“

142
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:10,055
my parents loved me so much,
it was crazy.

143
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:13,433
I remember one Sunday afternoon,
my mother said,

144
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,937
"your father and I want to spend
quality family time together.

145
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,439
"All the kids in school
envy your intelligence

146
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,149
"and kickball ability.

147
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:23,085
Here's an ice cream sundae."

148
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,528
No, wait.
"An ice-cream sandwich."

149
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,740
No. "A dreamsicle."

150
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,575
Ah, no. I don't know.
This is dumb.

151
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:33,703
Nice writing, Shakespeare.

152
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,246
What did I do?

153
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,459
Just need something
to help me focus.

154
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:40,794
Coffee.

155
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,796
No, no. Cigarettes.

156
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,172
No, Tequila!

157
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,967
Ah, no, I just need
the right music...

158
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:50,679
To do drugs to.

159
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,764
J“ work it j'

160
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,350
Sarah Lynn, I know things
got kind of out of hand

161
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:58,311
last time when I tried to
make you stop doing drugs.

162
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,558
So I just want to thank you
for coming over this time

163
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,190
to give me drugs.

164
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,234
Well, you can't go wrong
with Dr. Hu's drugs.

165
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,986
They're from another dimension.

166
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,312
These are gonna help me
focus and get work done, right?

167
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,615
Oh, yes. These are what
I give college students

168
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,660
so when they come to, their term
papers have written themselves.

169
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,412
That's exactly what he needs.

170
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,914
Also, I should probably
do another one.

171
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,210
Oh, it's "hu." Dr. Hu.

172
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,337
That's right, Dr. Hu.
Dr. Allen hu.

173
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,007
No, no, no, but I thought
it was "who," like "doctor who."

174
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,591
Yes, that's exactly
what it's like.

175
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:32,512
No, not h-u, but, who,
like, "hello, who is it?"

176
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,431
Uh, I don't know. Who is it?

177
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,325
I'm sorry, is this a joke?
Is he telling a joke

178
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,059
- that I just don't...
- Hard to tell.

179
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:41,021
Sometimes I just laugh after he
talks so he'll leave me alone.

180
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,857
Seriously? Am I the only one
who knows the extremely popular

181
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,359
BBC science fiction show about
the time traveling doctor

182
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,445
- who saves civilizations?
- Oh, yeah.

183
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,531
I know what you're
talking about... "Doctor who."

184
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,616
- Yes, thank you. "Doctor who."
- Yes?

185
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,244
I saw the one where
she goes to the wild west.

186
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,371
The Cheyenne called her
medicine woman.

187
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,415
What? No, that's Dr. Quinn.

188
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,542
- Who's Dr. Quinn?
- I most certainly am not.

189
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,295
Hu's not Dr. Quinn. Hu's Dr. Hu.

190
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,297
I don't know. Both: Third base!

191
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:08,944
When are these drugs
going to kick in?

192
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,650
Any minute now,
if they haven't already.

193
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,844
I want you to take three
of these every hour

194
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,305
and take two of these
every 1/2 hour.

195
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,599
Whatever you do, don't take
more than four of these

196
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,851
every 90 minutes, and take
the first two of the three

197
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,437
before you take
the second two of the four.

198
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,684
And don't expose yourself
to bright light or get wet.

199
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,192
- So... gremlin rules?
- Exactly!

200
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,736
Well, I'm off to perform
child heart surgery.

201
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,821
Wish me luck.

202
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,284
All right, team, focus up.

203
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,787
We got a book to write.

204
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,705
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, my god, this is so good.

205
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,248
It's good.

206
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,709
So good, so good.

207
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:48,630
Okay, Todd, how is it going
with the heartwarming anecdotes?

208
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,465
Great! I'm writing
about that time

209
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,425
we officially became
best friends.

210
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,011
Nice! Can you change
best to pretty good?

211
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,597
Sarah Lynn, how's it coming with
the "horsin' around" years?

212
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,100
Almost done with the story
where hulk hogan guest starred

213
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,559
and told us to say no to drugs.

214
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,312
Great. Keep typing, monkeys.

215
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,773
If only hulk hogan
could see us now, right?

216
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,525
What?

217
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,152
Because Sarah Lynn said
the thing about hulk hogan?

218
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,571
That was like four hours ago.

219
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,365
Oh, uh, right.

220
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,158
- How we doing now?
- Sending.

221
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,369
- Just about to send.
- Nice.

222
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:20,829
Okay, this is great.

223
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,039
That puts us at 216 pages?

224
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:26,209
Holy shit, that's almost as long
as "the firm" by John Grisham.

225
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,211
And we just needed
to get to 200, right?

226
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:29,587
I'm just gonna keep writing.

227
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,382
I got a lot of synapses
firing right now.

228
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,635
It's surprisingly literate
and insightful, but still fun.

229
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,179
It's a beach read you can
thumb through in a wing chair.

230
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,223
Can't believe Diane
thought this was so hard.

231
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,976
"Ow, my fingers are cramping
from all this typing.

232
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,436
It's like they're
having their period."

233
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,063
Did Diane really say that?

234
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,357
No, but my fingers are cramping.

235
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:52,402
It's like they're having
their period, am I right?

236
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,281
Are you just laughing
so I'll leave you alone?

237
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,117
Good one.

238
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,161
We just need a way
to end this thing.

239
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,037
What should the ending be?

240
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,957
-Maybe it was earth all along.

241
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,959
Not that,
but something like that.

242
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:09,460
Keep thinking.

243
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,013
I got it!

244
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,223
Did you guys switch clothes?

245
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,474
Sarah's voice: No.

246
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,062
- Uh... what... huh...
- I don't know.

247
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,647
I like your idea better, bojack.

248
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,174
- What?
- Your idea for the ending.

249
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,636
- Oh, what'd I say?
- About Maine.

250
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,319
About how you end up in Maine.

251
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,779
I like the part where you swim
in the lake in the summers.

252
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,908
Yeah, right, and when I get
too old to take care of myself,

253
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,576
I go for one last swim.

254
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,203
I know I can't make it
back to shore.

255
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,787
I'm too weak, too tired.

256
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,207
So I just let the water
take me under.

257
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,001
Eesh! Downer ending.

258
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,170
- You got something better?
- Wait a minute.

259
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,172
Maybe we don't know
the ending yet

260
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,049
because you haven't lived it.

261
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,259
Yeah, I mean,
if you want to, like, finish

262
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,512
finish the book, then you'd
have to, like, die tonight.

263
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,682
Oh, I know! I should murder you.

264
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,353
I'm serious.

265
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,519
Think about it.

266
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:12,273
If the little girl
you raised on television

267
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,108
killed you in real life...

268
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:18,238
People would eat that shit up.

269
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,823
I love it. It's perfect.
We'll sell so many books.

270
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,285
Oh, yeah. Yeah, kill bojack!

271
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:29,082
- I'm gonna kill you!
- Oh, yes!

272
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,792
There it is!
Oh, yeah, gonna get you!

273
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:31,959
No, no, no, no...

274
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,211
Ah!

275
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,634
Okay, so what did we learn?

276
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,844
We learned that if
we're going to do drugs

277
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,722
we should do them at home where
it's safe to do them together,

278
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:45,932
right, Todd?

279
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,099
- No!
- Ahh!

280
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,518
Don't worry, guys.

281
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,770
I have this gun to keep
us safe from intruders.

282
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,438
- And each other.
- Wait, wait, wait.

283
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,041
Is that just
your gun-shaped lighter,

284
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:55,233
or your lighter-shaped gun?

285
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,360
Busted! It's just a lighter.

286
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:58,695
All: Aah!

287
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,113
Shit, I guess it's my gun.

288
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,656
Then what'd I do
with my lighter?

289
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,366
And what did I give
to that baby?

290
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,785
Ha, I have a gun, too.

291
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:09,122
Don't be a silly Billy.
That's a broom.

292
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,624
Wait, am I holding a gun?

293
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,335
Todd, are you holding
a gun or a broom?

294
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,130
I can't tell anymore!

295
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,674
I guess we'll just have
to shoot them at each other

296
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:22,719
at the same time to find out!

297
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,387
Okay!

298
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:26,824
Todd, sh... oh... can I just say...
Todd, Todd, I need you...

299
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,641
I need you to shh.
Listen, listen, Todd.

300
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,185
Okay, just to be totally clear,
we're shooting each other

301
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,646
to determine whether we're
holding guns or brooms, right?

302
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,533
Not because you're still mad
about the whole

303
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,001
me sabotaging you
with the rock opera

304
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,502
and your live stream
and suchety-such?

305
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,153
Bojack, shh, shh, okay, Bo?

306
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,863
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet.

307
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,489
As you know, I was hurt,

308
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,533
but then I realized
that's just how you are.

309
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,161
You know, and maybe I just
need to stop expecting you

310
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,996
to be a good person,

311
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,832
so that way, I won't
get hurt when you're not.

312
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,876
Oh, o... okay.

313
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,544
Hey, this isn't fair.

314
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:57,879
I don't have a gun.

315
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,756
Sarah Lynn is right.

316
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,109
You know, if we all had guns,
then no one would need a gun,

317
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:03,133
and we would all be safe.

318
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,677
Oh, my god.

319
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,764
I think we just solved
the gun crisis in america.

320
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:09,891
Let them eat guns!

321
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,477
Bang, bang, pow,
pow, yeah, oh, wow!

322
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:15,229
Let's celebrate...
By taking more drugs.

323
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,028
Now we just have to solve
the drug crisis in america.

324
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,571
Easy! We'll take them all.

325
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,031
Yes!

326
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,699
J“ madness,
chaos in the brain j“

327
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,326
j“ let my blood flow j“

328
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,703
j“ make my blood flow
through you, man j“

329
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,915
j“ you've got no business
questioning a thing j“

330
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,673
Bojack?

331
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,012
Hey, sorry. You okay?

332
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,722
Yeah...

333
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,558
Listen, I've thought about it,
and you're right.

334
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,186
Your memoir should be
a representation of you.

335
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:57,897
It's only fair you're happy
with how you're portrayed.

336
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,565
- Really?
- Yeah.

337
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,693
And I want to help write
a book we can both be proud of.

338
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,947
Oh, my god. Thank you.

339
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,698
Thank you.

340
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,329
Oh, what? Ooh!

341
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,415
- Are you okay?
- Oh, no!

342
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,417
Not this again!

343
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,252
Gaaaaahhhh!

344
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,921
What is happening!

345
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:26,968
I ate too many pancakes!

346
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,262
Oh, shit, I'm still tripping.

347
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:39,105
- Kiss me.
- Oh, go...

348
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:51,242
Ah... ah... oh!
Oh, oh, ah, ah...

349
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:04,922
You abandoned me, and I will
never forgive you for that.

350
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,175
I'm Mr. Peanut...
I'm Mr. Peanut...

351
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,676
I'm Mr. Peanutbutter.

352
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,470
Oh, my god!

353
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,139
What?

354
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,516
Hoo hoo hah hah hah...

355
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,393
Ah!

356
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,355
Whoa.

357
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,647
What the...

358
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,734
Whoa! Okay, stay calm.

359
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,361
I don't have outlines anymore.
That's okay.

360
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,947
There's no boundary
between me and space.

361
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,116
This is a thing that happens.

362
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,873
Shouldn't we help him?

363
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,791
No, he loves treading water.

364
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,169
Oh... oh, god.

365
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:48,007
Uh-oh.

366
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,801
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

367
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,809
Why is everyone laughing?
What's so funny?

368
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,061
Cut! Get your head

369
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:01,771
out of your ass, b.J.

370
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:06,567
Your line is, "this is all I am
and all I'll ever be."

371
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,736
This is all I am
and all I'll ever be.

372
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:11,697
You can say that again, old man.

373
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:20,748
J“ oh j“

374
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:23,125
- horse, horse, horse!
- What is it?

375
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,879
Will you make me a penis
butter and va-jelly sandwich?

376
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,589
What?

377
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:32,843
I said, make me a penis butter
va-jelly sandwich, bitch.

378
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,263
No, no.

379
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,935
Well, isn't it too late
to say no, bojack?

380
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:43,479
This is the road you chose.

381
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,441
I'm sinking, somebody help.

382
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,193
The floor is tar.

383
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,529
Why don't you come with me?
Come to Maine.

384
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,155
I can't, I'm stuck.

385
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,991
Do they have pinkberry in Maine?

386
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,492
I can't!

387
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,995
- Go out there.
- I can't.

388
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,205
Can't lives in a house
on won't street.

389
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:04,250
You will not embarrass me in
front of the entire supper club.

390
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:08,004
I told them you were going
to sing the "lollipop" song.

391
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,672
But I don't feel like singing.

392
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,591
Nobody gives a damn
what you feel.

393
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,217
You've got an audience
out there,

394
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,094
and they want to hear you sing.

395
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,971
Now, you want your mommy
to love you?

396
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:20,349
You go out there and you do
the only thing you're good for,

397
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:24,395
which is singing
the goddamn "lollipop" song.

398
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,063
And let me tell you somethin':

399
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,691
The secret to living
forever is...

400
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,280
Oh, no.

401
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:35,447
Hey.

402
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,328
What seems to be the problem?

403
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,330
Good grief. I'm so depressed.

404
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,998
I just want everyone to love me,

405
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:45,725
but I don't know
how to make them do it.

406
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,501
You can't force love,
you blockhead.

407
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,646
All you can do is be good
to the people in your life,

408
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,921
and keep your heart open.

409
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,131
I screwed it all up.

410
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,400
It's too late for me, isn't it?

411
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:54,424
I don't know.

412
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,777
I'm just a crazy
drug hallucination.

413
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,094
I'll say whatever
you want me to.

414
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:59,513
Then tell me it's not too late.

415
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,408
Well, it's not too late.
It's never too late.

416
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:02,909
- Yeah, that's right.
- It's never too late

417
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,810
to be the person you want to be.

418
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,063
You need to choose
the life you want.

419
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:10,733
That'll be 5¢ please...

420
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:23,829
Bojack.

421
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,081
Yes, dear?

422
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,707
Supper's ready.

423
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,543
Ran into ed
at the hardware store.

424
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,030
He said we're
in for some weather.

425
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,930
What the hell does that mean?
"Some weather."

426
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,340
We're always
in for some weather.

427
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,175
Guess what, ed?
There's never not weather.

428
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,137
Oh, bojack, don't.

429
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,972
Come on, I can't help it.

430
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,979
It's just so cute
how they do it automatically.

431
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,476
How do they know?

432
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:48,020
Oh, man, can we just stay
exactly like this

433
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,897
for the rest of our lives,
please?

434
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:54,318
Yeah, okay, sure, uh, or we
could do the opposite of that,

435
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:56,278
because I'm pregnant.

436
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,322
What? That's amazing.

437
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,950
Yeah, and I'm 80% sure
it's yours.

438
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,372
Is it weird that I want
to make love to you right now?

439
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,332
Why would that be weird?

440
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:10,835
I don't know, it's...
I don't want to spook the baby.

441
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,920
Maybe we should just
do mouth and hand stuff

442
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,964
for the next nine months.

443
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,182
Oh, I think someone's awake.

444
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,393
Dada coming? Dada coming?

445
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,603
Yes, gooby girl, dada's coming.

446
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,355
Dada.

447
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:32,898
I'm gonna eat your finger.

448
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,065
Yum, yum, num, num.

449
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:40,239
- Daddy?
- Harper?

450
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,907
Where do the stars go?

451
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,617
Oh, they're still there.

452
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,287
We just can't see them
because the sun is shining.

453
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:48,497
- Oh. Daddy?
- Harper?

454
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:52,209
Do you think if you were a
little kid, we would be friends?

455
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,044
Well, that depends.

456
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,672
Do you love cookies,
and the color green, and braids?

457
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,883
Yes, I love all those things.

458
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,093
Well, then, your application
has been submitted

459
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,137
and is pending board approval.

460
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,889
Approved!

461
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,808
Wah!

462
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,227
Whoa!

463
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,021
Oh, no splashing!

464
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,856
Oh, no.
Oh, oh, it's rough, oh, don't.

465
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,316
Oh, oh, you're tickling.

466
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:17,109
I got you!

467
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,694
She grew up so fast.

468
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,863
I don't like that
he drives a motorcycle.

469
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,907
Honey, a Vespa
is not a motorcycle.

470
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,243
Okay, okay.

471
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,162
What are you thinking about?

472
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,790
Oh, just how nice
things could've been

473
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,666
if you had chosen this life.

474
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,676
Oh... what? Where?

475
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,261
Hello?

476
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,308
Bojack, I read the pages
you sent me last night,

477
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,767
and I have to tell you,
your book is absolutely,

478
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,852
without a doubt, the most...

479
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,187
Gibberish.

480
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,189
- It's gibberish.
- What day is it?

481
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:56,982
Let's see what you got here.

482
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,127
You got 20 pages of
"doctor who" erotic fan fiction,

483
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,445
a recipe for soup,
five different theories

484
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:02,988
about how 9/11 happened,

485
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,949
and a bunch
of embedded YouTube videos

486
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,326
that can't possibly
be printed in book form.

487
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,703
Okay, I gotta go.

488
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,501
Any questions, at all,

489
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:18,087
for our panel of ghost writers?

490
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:21,131
Um, yeah, I have a question
for Tori spelling.

491
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:25,052
Again, Tori spelling is not
here, as I already explained.

492
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:27,930
Tori spelling's
ghost writer is here.

493
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,849
This is a ghost writer
convention.

494
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,392
How do you not...

495
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,019
Okay, next question?

496
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,605
Uh, yeah,
this is for the whole panel.

497
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,608
What's your favorite kind
of ghost to write for?

498
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,444
What?
No, they don't write for ghosts.

499
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,656
That's not what? Why did I think
this would be a good idea?

500
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:49,243
Does anyone have
an actual question

501
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,328
for someone on this panel?

502
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:55,332
An actual question, or a gun,
so I can shoot myself?

503
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,499
Yeah, I got a question.

504
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,127
Oh, thank god.

505
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:00,629
My question is for Diane.

506
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,841
Look, I'm sorry about all the
stuff I said about you earlier.

507
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:05,676
We can publish
the book you wrote.

508
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:07,553
You're obviously a better
writer than I am,

509
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,180
and I don't actually
even really care

510
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,182
what the world thinks
about me anymore.

511
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,018
I just hated reading that book

512
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,395
because I hated feeling like
that's how you saw me.

513
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:19,064
Because I guess you know me
better than anybody,

514
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,442
and if you think that...

515
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:24,153
I guess my question is, do you...

516
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,280
Do you think
it's too late for me?

517
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:28,073
What?

518
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,701
I mean, am I just doomed
to be the person that I am?

519
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:32,745
The... the person in that book?

520
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,748
It's not too late for me, is it?
It's... it's not too late...

521
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,208
Diane, I need you to tell me
that it's not too late.

522
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,294
- Bojack, I...
- I... I need you to tell me

523
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:41,837
that I'm a good person.

524
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:43,764
I know that I can be selfish
and narcissistic

525
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:45,716
and self-destructive,
but underneath all that,

526
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:47,384
deep down, I'm a good person,

527
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,929
and I need you to tell me
that I'm good, Diane.

528
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:54,099
Tell me, please, Diane.
Tell me that I'm good.

529
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:12,868
Hey, aren't you the horse
from "horsin' around"?

530
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,620

531
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:19,708

00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:25,172

534
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:29,134

j“ and I'm trying to hold on to my past j“

536
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:36,892
j“ it's been so long j“

537
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:40,354
j“ I don't think I'm gonna last j“

538
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:41,730
j“ I guess I'll just try j”

539
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,899

541

j“ or I'm more man than a horse j“

542
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:55,035
j“ bojack j“

543
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,580
boxer versus raptor.
