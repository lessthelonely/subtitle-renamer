So I just want to thank you
for coming over this time

174
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,190
to give me drugs.

175
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,234
Well, you can't go wrong
with Dr. Hu's drugs.

176
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,986
They're from another dimension.

177
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,312
These are gonna help me
focus and get work done, right?

178
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,615
Oh, yes. These are what
I give college students

179
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,660
so when they come to, their term
papers have written themselves.

180
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,412
That's exactly what he needs.

181
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,914
Also, I should probably
do another one.

182
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,708
[Sniffs]

183
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,210
Oh, it's "hu." Dr. Hu.

184
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,337
That's right, Dr. Hu.
Dr. Allen hu.

185
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,007
No, no, no, but I thought
it was "who," like "doctor who."

186
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,591
Yes, that's exactly
what it's like.

187
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:32,512
No, not h-u, but, who,
like, "hello, who is it?"

188
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,431
Uh, I don't know. Who is it?

189
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,325
I'm sorry, is this a joke?
Is he telling a joke

190
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,059
- that I just don't...
- Hard to tell.

191
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:41,021
Sometimes I just laugh after he
talks so he'll leave me alone.

192
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,857
Seriously? Am I the only one
who knows the extremely popular

193
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,359
BBC science fiction show about
the time traveling doctor

194
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,445
- who saves civilizations?
- Oh, yeah.

195
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,531
I know what you're
talking about... "Doctor who."

196
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,616
- Yes, thank you. "Doctor who."
- Yes?

197
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,244
I saw the one where
she goes to the wild west.

198
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,371
The Cheyenne called her
medicine woman.

199
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,415
What? No, that's Dr. Quinn.

200
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,542
- Who's Dr. Quinn?
- I most certainly am not.

201
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,295
Hu's not Dr. Quinn. Hu's Dr. Hu.

202
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,297
I don't know. Both: Third base!

203
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:08,944
When are these drugs
going to kick in?

204
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,650
Any minute now,
if they haven't already.

205
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,844
I want you to take three
of these every hour

206
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,305
and take two of these
every 1/2 hour.

207
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,599
Whatever you do, don't take
more than four of these

208
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,851
every 90 minutes, and take
the first two of the three

209
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,437
before you take
the second two of the four.

210
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,684
And don't expose yourself
to bright light or get wet.

211
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,192
- So... gremlin rules?
- Exactly!

212
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,736
Well, I'm off to perform
child heart surgery.

213
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,821
[Groans] Wish me luck.

214
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,574
[Sniffs]

215
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,284
All right, team, focus up.

216
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,787
We got a book to write.

217
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,705
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, my god, this is so good.

218
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,248
It's good.

219
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,709
So good, so good.
[Upbeat "action" music]

220
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:48,630
Okay, Todd, how is it going
with the heartwarming anecdotes?

221
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,465
Great! I'm writing
about that time

222
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,425
we officially became
best friends.

223
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,011
Nice! Can you change
best to pretty good?

224
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,597
Sarah Lynn, how's it coming with
the "horsin' around" years?

225
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,100
Almost done with the story
where hulk hogan guest starred

226
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,559
and told us to say no to drugs.

227
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,312
Great. Keep typing, monkeys.

228
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,773
If only hulk hogan
could see us now, right?

229
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,525
What?

230
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,152
Because Sarah Lynn said
the thing about hulk hogan?

231
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,571
That was like four hours ago.

232
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,365
Oh, uh, right.

233
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,158
- How we doing now?
- Sending.

234
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,369
- Just about to send.
- Nice.

235
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:20,829
Okay, this is great.

236
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,039
That puts us at 216 pages?

237
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:26,209
Holy shit, that's almost as long
as "the firm" by John Grisham.

238
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,211
And we just needed
to get to 200, right?

239
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:29,587
I'm just gonna keep writing.

240
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,382
I got a lot of synapses
firing right now.

241
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,635
It's surprisingly literate
and insightful, but still fun.

242
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,179
It's a beach read you can
thumb through in a wing chair.

243
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,223
Can't believe Diane
thought this was so hard.

244
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,976
"Ow, my fingers are cramping
from all this typing.

245
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,436
It's like they're
having their period."

246
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,063
Did Diane really say that?

247
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,357
No, but my fingers are cramping.

248
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:52,402
It's like they're having
their period, am I right?

249
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,027
[Laughs]

250
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,281
Are you just laughing
so I'll leave you alone?

251
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:57,699
[Laughs]

252
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,117
Good one.

253
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,161
We just need a way
to end this thing.

254
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,037
What should the ending be?

255
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,957
-Maybe it was earth all along.

256
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,959
Not that,
but something like that.

257
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:09,460
Keep thinking.

258
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:18,761
[Whinnies]

259
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,013
I got it!

260
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,223
Did you guys switch clothes?

261
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,474
Sarah's voice: No.

262
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,311
[Talking backwards]

263
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,062
- Uh... what... huh...
- I don't know.

264
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,647
I like your idea better, bojack.

265
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,174
- What?
- Your idea for the ending.

266
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,636
- Oh, what'd I say?
- About Maine.

267
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,319
About how you end up in Maine.

268
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,779
I like the part where you swim
in the lake in the summers.

269
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,908
Yeah, right, and when I get
too old to take care of myself,

270
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,576
I go for one last swim.

271
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,203
I know I can't make it
back to shore.

272
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,787
I'm too weak, too tired.

273
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,207
So I just let the water
take me under.

274
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,001
Eesh! Downer ending.

275
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,170
- You got something better?
- Wait a minute.

276
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,172
Maybe we don't know
the ending yet

277
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,049
because you haven't lived it.

278
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,259
Yeah, I mean,
if you want to, like, finish

279
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,512
finish the book, then you'd
have to, like, die tonight.

280
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,682
Oh, I know! I should murder you.

281
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,351
[Laughter]

282
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,353
I'm serious.

283
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,519
Think about it.

284
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:12,273
If the little girl
you raised on television

285
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,108
killed you in real life...

286
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:18,238
{gasps}
People would eat that shit up.

287
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,823
I love it. It's perfect.
We'll sell so many books.

288
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,285
Oh, yeah. Yeah, kill bojack!

289
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:29,082
- I'm gonna kill you!
- Oh, yes!

[All yelling]
[Ominous rock music]

00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,634
Okay, so what did we learn?

295
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,844
We learned that if
we're going to do drugs

296
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,722
we should do them at home where
it's safe to do them together,

297
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:45,932
right, Todd?

- No!
- Ahh!

Don't worry, guys.

us safe from intruders.

Shit, I guess it's my gun.

Then what'd I do
with my lighter?

308
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,366
And what did I give
to that baby?

Ha, I have a gun, too.

Don't be a silly Billy.
That's a broom.

00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,335
Todd, are you holding
a gun or a broom?

313
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,130
I can't tell anymore!

314
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,674
I guess we'll just have
to shoot them at each other

315
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:22,719
at the same time to find out!

316
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,387
Okay!

317
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:26,824

Todd, Todd, I need you...

318

I need you to shh.
Listen, listen, Todd.

319
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,185
Okay, just to be totally clear,
we're shooting each other

320
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,646
to determine whether we're
holding guns or brooms, right?

321
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,533
Not because you're still mad
about the whole

Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet.

326
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,489
As you know, I was hurt,

327
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,533
but then I realized
that's just how you are.

328
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,161
You know, and maybe I just
need to stop expecting you

329
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,996
to be a good person,

330
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,832
so that way, I won't
get hurt when you're not.

Oh, o... okay.

Hey, this isn't fair.

333
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:57,879
I don't have a gun.

Sarah Lynn is right.

335
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,109
You know, if we all had guns,
then no one would need a gun,

336
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:03,133
and we would all be safe.

337
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,677
Oh, my god.

338
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,764
I think we just solved
the gun crisis in america.

339
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:09,891
Let them eat guns!

[Cell phone vibrating]

519
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,676
Oh... what? Where?
[Vibrating, music playing]

520
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,261
Hello?

521
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,308
Bojack, I read the pages
you sent me last night,

522
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,767
and I have to tell you,
your book is absolutely,

523
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,852
without a doubt, the most...

524
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,187
Gibberish.

525
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,189
- It's gibberish.
- What day is it?

526
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:56,982
Let's see what you got here.

527
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,127
You got 20 pages of
"doctor who" erotic fan fiction,

528
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,445
a recipe for soup,
five different theories

529
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:02,988
about how 9/11 happened,

530
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,949
and a bunch
of embedded YouTube videos

531
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,326
that can't possibly
be printed in book form.

532
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,703
Okay, I gotta go. [Beep]

533
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,501
Any questions, at all,

534
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:18,087
for our panel of ghost writers?

535
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:21,131
Um, yeah, I have a question
for Tori spelling.

536
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:25,052
Again, Tori spelling is not
here, as I already explained.

537
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:27,930
Tori spelling's
ghost writer is here.

538
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,849
This is a ghost writer
convention.

539
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,392
How do you not...

540
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:32,559
[Clears throat]

541
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,019
Okay, next question?

542
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,605
Uh, yeah,
this is for the whole panel.

543
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,608
What's your favorite kind
of ghost to write for?

544
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,444
What?
No, they don't write for ghosts.

545
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,656
That's not what? Why did I think
this would be a good idea?

546
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:49,243
Does anyone have
an actual question

547
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,328
for someone on this panel?

548
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:55,332
An actual question, or a gun,
so I can shoot myself?

549
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,499
Yeah, I got a question.

550
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,127
Oh, thank god.

551
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:00,629
[Microphone feedback]
My question is for Diane.

552
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,841
Look, I'm sorry about all the
stuff I said about you earlier.

553
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:05,676
We can publish
the book you wrote.

554
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:07,553
You're obviously a better
writer than I am,

555
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,180
and I don't actually
even really care

556
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,182
what the world thinks
about me anymore.

557
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,018
I just hated reading that book

558
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,395
because I hated feeling like
that's how you saw me.

559
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:19,064
Because I guess you know me
better than anybody,

560
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,442
and if you think that...

561
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:24,153
I guess my question is, do you...

562
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,280
Do you think
it's too late for me?

563
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:28,073
What?

564
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,701
I mean, am I just doomed
to be the person that I am?

565
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:32,745
The... the person in that book?

566
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,748
It's not too late for me, is it?
It's... it's not too late...

567
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,208
Diane, I need you to tell me
that it's not too late.

568
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,294
- Bojack, I...
- I... I need you to tell me

569
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:41,837
that I'm a good person.

570
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:43,764
I know that I can be selfish
and narcissistic

571
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:45,716
and self-destructive,
but underneath all that,

572
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:47,384
deep down, I'm a good person,

573
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,929
and I need you to tell me
that I'm good, Diane.

574
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:54,099
Tell me, please, Diane.
Tell me that I'm good.
