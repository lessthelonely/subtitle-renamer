1
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:11,762
I'm sorry
I broke your expensive bachelor vase.

2
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:12,929
Aw.

3
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:15,891
That's all right. I've learned
that when you're in a loving family

4
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:18,936
there's nothing wrong
with a little horsing around.

5
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:21,604
Cut!

6
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:22,731
That's the show, folks.

7
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:25,400
Now, let's hear it for our amazing cast.

8
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,528
Joelle. Bradley.

9
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,112
Little Sarah Lynn.

10
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:32,574
And our star, bojack horseman!

11
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,453
Aw. Thanks for coming out.
Thank you very much.

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,872
- Wow.
- Great pilot.

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,584
We got the biggest laugh I ever heard
with that "gag me with a spoon" joke.

14
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,629
And then we topped it
with the "get a room" joke.

15
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,130
This was so fun.

16
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:48,715
Do we get to make more?

17
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,342
I think we got a real shot.

18
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:54,012
And as long as the ratings don't dip
below a dismal 15 million a night,

19
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,889
we could be on the air for many years.

20
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:56,890
- No way!
- All right!

21
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,433
- Your squirt, sir.
- Thank you.

22
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,894
And if that happens,
take care of each other.

23
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:04,523
No matter what,
we're going to stick together.

24
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,681
Thank you, Tina,
for those touching grunts and growls.

25
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:20,848
I'm Henry winkler.

26
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:24,353
You probably remember me
from my 2002 guest role

27
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,438
on law & order: Special victims unit.

28
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:27,606
- Whoo!
- Thank you.

29
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:31,318
But perhaps the greatest role
I've ever played is friend.

30
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,903
Herb was a dear friend

31
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:37,532
and I am honored to be dedicating
this bench in his memory.

32
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,537
In his last days, herb's cancer
had gone into remission.

33
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:43,705
He was full of hope.

34
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:47,000
But on the drive home from the hospital,
his brakes gave out,

35
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,544
he crashed into a truck full of peanuts.

36
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,798
He survived the crash,
but he was allergic to peanuts.

37
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,007
He died instantly.

38
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,094
Let us now read his final tweets.

39
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:59,471
"I'm gonna live forever!

40
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:00,847
Hashtag 'cancer free.'

41
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,724
hashtag 'invincible.'

42
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,477
hashtag 'tweeting while driving.'

43
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:07,854
oh, no, I think I'm gonna hit that truck.

44
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,108
Hashtag 'hopefully it isn't full
of peanuts.'

45
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:14,403
hashtag 'oh, no. It was full of peanuts.

46
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,447
I was wondering
where you wandered off to.

47
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,116
- Oh, shn.Hey.
- Hey.

48
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:21,076
I'm no good with funerals.

49
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:24,830
When I cry, it messes up my makeup
and then I get really bummed out.

50
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:25,831
Yeah, same for me.

51
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,999
Herb told me you came
by the house last summer.

52
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,459
Yeah?

53
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,129
Did he tell you anything else?

54
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:35,340
No, we talked about cancer,
how hard it is living with cancer,

55
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,551
about the la. Kings,
and then back to cancer.

56
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,886
- Probably...
- Then I read that chapter in your book

57
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,893
about how he never forgave you
and he tried to kick you out of the house

58
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,600
and you ended up wrestling on the floor
over a telescope.

59
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,353
- Oh, you did read that part?
- Yeah. Heh.

60
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,565
I just wish
there was something I could do.

61
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:53,441
Okay, I gotta go.

62
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,402
Wait, I haven't seen you in 30 years.

63
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,613
You wanna go grab a cup of vodka?
I... I'm sorry, the funeral.

64
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,990
I mean, a bottle of vodka?

65
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,783
No. You should stick around.

66
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,578
Hey, maybe you'll find
that something you're looking for.

67
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,539
But if you're ever in new Mexico,
drop me a line.

68
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:08,540
New Mexico?

69
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:09,875
I thought you lived in Maine.

70
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,376
I always pictured you there.

71
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:12,627
A little house by a lake?

72
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:15,589
Heh. I was just there for, like, a month,
30 years ago.

73
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,758
I live outside Santa fe now.

74
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,561
- Do you think everyone here read my book?
- Well, I didn't.

75
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:30,771
Of course you didn't.

76
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,939
Here's the cliffsnotes version:
Shut up, Todd!

77
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,567
Okay, you're clearly in one of your moods.

78
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:39,488
I'm gonna go play astronaut in the trunk
of your car for the next few hours.

79
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:40,989
Have fun being sad.

80
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,784
Do you know what you're supposed to do
with our date pits?

81
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,453
Why serve dates
and not have a place to put the pits?

82
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,497
You know, some people just have no class.

83
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,463
What are you doing here?
You didn't know herb.

84
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:54,002
No, but I do know a hot ticket,
and this funeral's a real whom's-whom.

85
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,588
Henry winkler,
Jake and maggot Gyllenhaal,

86
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:59,508
that Pakistani girl
who keeps winning nobel prizes.

87
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,009
I'm gonna go rub me some elbows.

88
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,470
There's so much to hate
about what you just said.

89
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,765
Good news. You know when someone dies,
everyone wants to buy their shit?

90
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,812
You're lucky you have a piece
of horsin' around,

91
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,852
because this is where money
starts rolling in.

92
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,771
I don't want that money.
That's blood money.

93
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,440
Well, what do you want me to do with it?
It's coming.

94
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,317
I don't know. Give it to some orphans.

95
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,361
- I can't deal with this.
- Oh, come on!

96
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,572
You don't think Elton John
was raking it in when Diana died?

97
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:26,910
More like "candle in the windfall."
Cha-ching! Hmm.

98
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:32,415
You have to live with the shitty
thing you did for the rest of your life.

99
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,709
Huh.

100
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,586
Hello, love.

101
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,089
Hey, joelle,
I actually came here to be alone.

102
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,508
I'm at my wit's end, I truly am.

103
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,761
I just flew in across the pond
and I don't know which end is up.

104
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:48,849
This might be a stupid question,
but were you always so British?

105
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:52,060
Oh, let's get some light in here,
it's so dreadfully dreary.

106
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,896
Because I'm, like, 70 percent sure
you used to be American.

107
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:55,897
That's better.

108
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,775
Hey, this one's having a freak-out.
She needs to lie down.

109
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,026
I'm not freaking out.

110
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,904
I just don't understand
why that lady was being all judgy.

111
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:06,658
You were touching her face
and telling her she was gonna die next.

112
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,869
I'm eccentric. I do weird shit.

113
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,912
How is that my problem?

114
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:14,708
Hey, when was the last time
all four of us were in the same room?

115
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,835
Probably not since the show ended.

116
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,546
Yeah, I left California
pretty much right after.

117
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,965
Now I got the biggest hardware store
in Seattle.

118
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,217
That's a lie. We're actually in Olympia.

119
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:28,179
And I'm on the west end
playing Juliet's nurse.

120
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,599
- And how are your kids?
- I don't have any kids.

121
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,726
Oh, I just assumed
you had a bunch of kids,

122
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,811
because, you know, your body.

123
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:35,812
Come on, Sarah Lynn.

124
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,898
I assumed
you weren't still a massive cunt.

125
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,984
- Jesus Christ, joelle.
- That's an okay thing to say in england.

126
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,153
Shove it up your ass
with a spoonful of sugar,

127
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,031
you supercalifragilisticexpiali-bitch!

128
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,033
- Guys, hey, hey, come on.
- Let go of me!

129
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,036
- I'm gonna hulk out!
- Guys, can we just be civil for one day?

130
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,347
- Oh, you're one to talk.
- What's that supposed to mean?

131
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,874
Were you being civil
when you had sex with my mom?

132
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:59,669
What? I never... why would...? Wait, which
one was your mom? Blond hair? Glasses?

133
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,589
- No.
- This sucks. You guys suck.

134
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,633
I don't even know
why I came to this party.

135
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,801
It's not a party, it's herb's funeral.

136
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:07,969
Herb died?

137
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:11,222
You know, maybe it's for the best
we don't get together that often.

138
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,516
We'd most likely drive each other mad.

139
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,144
Well, no one knows how to get
under your skin like family.

140
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:17,646
We're not a family, bojack.

141
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:21,066
We probably won't even see
each other again, until the next funeral.

142
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,111
- Why are you all looking at me?
- You are the oldest.

143
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,821
You are a severe alcoholic.

144
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:30,158
I'm honestly so high right now,
I don't even know where I'm looking.

145
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:33,203
Anyway, so long, thanks for the memories,

146
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,081
and don't forget to suck a dick, dumbshi...

147
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:39,209
Pardon me. Is one of you Sarah Lynn?

148
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,920
I am. Of course. God, are you blind?

149
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,339
Well, forgive me.

150
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,050
I'm herb kazzaz's blind executor.

151
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:53,723
Per the instructions of his last will
and testament, I am to give you this disk.

152
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:55,016
Am I close?

153
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,851
Just take the disk from the guy.

154
00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:00,105
It contains directions to herb's gold.

155
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,523
Herb's gold?

156
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,358
There were no further details.

157
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,151
He was a peculiar client.

158
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,779
I told him, I'm not actually an attorney,

159
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,239
I'm just a blind man.

160
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,575
Still, herb thought me wise
for some reason.

161
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,996
Perhaps it is
my overly formal manner of speech.

162
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,082
I bid you good day.

163
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,917
Oh, pardon me. Ow.

164
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,335
Right at shin level.

165
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,385
What are we supposed to do
with a floppy disk?

166
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,256
So, what's up, kiddo?

167
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:30,051
Bojack and my mom
are becoming, like, friends

168
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,720
and they're acting real weird.

169
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:32,929
Oof. Uh...

170
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,558
Hey, guys, guys, come on!

171
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,059
There's somebody beneath you!

172
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,686
Jeez, all day with the...

173
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,354
Listen, kiddo, forget about them.

174
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:44,649
You wanna check out
this cool new game I got?

175
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:46,693
You have solitaire?
On your computer?

176
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,529
Yep. It only took 12 disks to install it.

177
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:50,905
Wow.

178
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,949
Herb's computer had a floppy disk drive.

179
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:56,661
I bet it's still in his old office.
Unless somebody else moved in.

180
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,538
Nobody wanted herb's office, remember?

181
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:02,333
Because it was under tap dancing star
savion glover's office. Let's go.

182
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,711
- What? Right now?
- Yeah. Don't you get it?

183
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,588
Herb's giving us a reunion special.

184
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:10,091
Remember how he always wanted to do
a treasure hunt episode of horsin' around

185
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:13,219
but the network said it was too edgy?
This is that episode.

186
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,847
- I just don't know.
- Yeah, I don't want to do that.

187
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,850
Wait, so you would rather just stay
at this funeral and be sad,

188
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:22,729
instead of going on a crazy adventure
to find our dead friend's secret treasure?

189
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,731
Do you have any idea
how insane you all sound?

190
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,734
Oh, I get it.
You just don't wanna be here.

191
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:28,901
No, that's not it.

192
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,863
Herb clearly wanted us to do this,
as a family.

193
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,114
Who cares what he wanted?

194
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,991
He doesn't, because he's dead.

195
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,993
And we all know he hated your guts.

196
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,579
Yeah. He was my best friend
and he died hating me

197
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,331
and nothing I do is gonna change that,

198
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:44,584
but herb left you that disk
because he wanted us to find his gold.

199
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:48,630
If we can honor herb's last wish,
then that's something.

200
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,715
I don't know what, but it's something.

201
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,886
- Okay. For herb.
- Fine.

202
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,806
- Shotgun!
- Everyone knows you can't call shotgun

203
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,350
- before you see the car!
- My turn! Get out of the way!

204
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,976
Brad, hang on one second.

205
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,854
Your mom wasn't redheaded twins, right?

206
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,691
Hi, Henry winkler.

207
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:12,028
I loved you in that one episode
of law & order: Svu.

208
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,780
Oh, thank you.

209
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,324
How would you like
to narrate a documentary for...

210
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,284
Hey, listen, I am so flattered,

211
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,830
but today is about herb,
so let's respect that.

212
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,082
Oh, god, I... I'm so sorry.

213
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,918
I'll let you get back to your business.

214
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:32,006
Hey, winkly! Oh, such a shame, isn't it?
About our friend herb?

215
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,842
It really burns my brisket

216
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:37,053
that some people would turn a funeral
into some kind of schmoozefest.

217
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,930
Yeah. I know.

218
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,558
Those other people are the worst.

219
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,726
I bet that woman barely knew herb.

220
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,520
Anyway, hi, I'm Henry.

221
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:48,148
I used to volunteer with herb
at habitat for humanity.

222
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:52,026
Or as we like to call it,
herbitat for henranity. Ha-ha-ha.

223
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,196
We spent most of the day working
on that name,

224
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,575
and only part of the day building
but, still, we helped some people.

225
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:02,787
- How did you know herb?
- We also volunteered at a, uh,

226
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:08,001
soup plantation... kitchen! Soup kitchen!
Uh, whichever one is the good one.

227
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,545
What? I never knew you did that.

228
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:12,547
Princess Carolyn, please elaborate.

229
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:16,342
Oh, hey, Mr. Peanutbutter, why don't you
talk about how you knew herb?

230
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:19,053
Oh, I never met the guy.
I'm just here to schmooze.

231
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,557
Tell us about your thing, though,
it sounds fascinating.

232
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:26,311
Ooh. Everyone, gather round
and listen to Princess Carolyn's story.

233
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:27,812
Okay.

234
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,152
Wow, herb kept all this old stuff.

235
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,778
He sure did.

236
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,032
Look, one of those answering machines
with tapes.

237
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,785
Mr. Kazzaz,
this is Manny from pep boys.

238
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,413
We fixed the brakes on your car,
you can pick it up tomorrow.

239
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,249
Just to reiterate,
your brakes are in great shape

240
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,585
and shouldn't give you any more trouble.

241
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:53,671
Unless, of course,
someone intentionally cut them,

242
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,466
but why would anyone do that?
I'm sorry, I'm rambling.

243
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,968
Probably because I'm such a big fan.

244
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:02,138
Horsin' around was a goddamn riot!

245
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,432
I especially loved those kids.

246
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,976
You know, wasn't so crazy
about the horse, though...

247
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,229
Message deleted.

248
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,813
Hmm. How curious.

249
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,417
How could you like
horsin' around but not like the horse?

250
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,443
That's like watching castle
but hating castles.

251
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,820
I mean, I've never seen it.
I assume it's about castles.

252
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:22,617
Wow! Look at all these
old 20th century relics.

253
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,079
- How did you get here?
- I was in your trunk.

254
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:29,832
Now I'm in outer space.

255
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,876
Todd, cut it out
with your childish high jinks.

256
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,461
Yeah, get out of here, dweeb.

257
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:34,796
Whoa, whoa, can't I help?

258
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:38,049
Here's 10 bucks. There's a squirt machine
by the garage. Get us five cans.

259
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:41,344
You got it. I won't let you down.
Ooh-hee-ooh-ha! Oh, no!

260
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,305
Your mom, was her name Karen?

261
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,140
- Can we drop it?
- Something with a k?

262
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:49,477
Her name is Nora. You know,
my parents got a divorce because of you.

263
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:54,107
Nora? I don't know.
I banged so many chicks in the '805.

264
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,986
Okay, Todd, you can do this.

265
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,152
Five squirts.

266
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,199
You just need to take this money
and put it in that machine.

267
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:06,077
This... wait, what?
What happened to the $10?

268
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,957
No! Wind! Be cool!

269
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,458
Hey! That's mine!

270
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:20,425
Why does this always happen to me?

271
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,054
Looks like herb set up a password.

272
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,598
Oh, this is easy. Try "bojack."

273
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:30,393
- No. Didn't work.
- "Bojack-bff"?

274
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,895
"Bojack-i-forgive-you"?

275
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,063
Well, I'm out of ideas.

276
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,190
Hmm.

277
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,235
I'm just, like, so mad.

278
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:42,780
Well, you should be.
You're on the show that fired herb kazzaz.

279
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,592
Tell me, what are the writers doing
to my baby? Are they killing it?

280
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:48,953
Are they putting my baby into a car,
then driving the car into a lake?

281
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,997
Topical! I still got it!

282
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,541
They keep giving the best story lines
to Sarah Lynn.

283
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,252
I haven't gotten
a single very special episode.

284
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,963
When am I gonna learn
about drunk driving?

285
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,966
Don't worry so much.
It's my legacy they're crapping all over.

286
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,153
You're gonna come out of this
smelling like a Daisy.

287
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,097
You're too good
for this TV stuff, anyway.

288
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,431
You're a real actress,
you should be doing theater.

289
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:09,390
Hold on.

290
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,060
Hey, joelle.
Wanna go to the mall this weekend?

291
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,437
Don't you have any friends
your own age from school?

292
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:18,149
No. My mom's boyfriend home-schools me.
He's a photographer.

293
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:21,444
I'm going to the Lilith fair this weekend
to support female solidarity.

294
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,821
- So scram!
- Oh.

295
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,991
Hey, be nicer to Sarah Lynn, will you?
She didn't choose this life.

296
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:29,077
Remember this word: Family.

297
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:32,246
Okay? You two are family,
whether you like it or not,

298
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:36,000
and that's the most important thing. You
listening? What's the most important thing?

299
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,878
Family. It's family. I get it.

300
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,756
I've got it! The password is

301
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,384
"password."

302
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,802
It worked!

303
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,095
Good thinking, joelle.

304
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,347
So in that memory,
were you British or American?

305
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:51,891
The disk just has just one file on it,
it's, uh...

306
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,519
It's the address of a storage locker
in Van nuys.

307
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,729
A storage locker? Ugh.

308
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,689
This treasure hunt sucks.

309
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,237
At long last, can you keep down the noise,
keep down the funk?

310
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:07,990
If tap dancing was gonna be a cool thing,
it would have caught on by now!

311
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,998
And when the mayor gave us
the key to the city,

312
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:21,838
herb said, "volunteering isn't about keys.
It's about people."

313
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,464
- How touching.
- Good story.

314
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,134
- Who are you again?
- Wow, that was touching.

315
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,718
A story that could never be topped.

316
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,220
Or could it?

317
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:33,141
Princess Carolyn, sing us another song
in the key of kazzaz.

318
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,143
You clearly knew the man so well.

319
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:39,188
Please tell us another story
but with even more details.

320
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:42,233
Yes. That's a great idea, Mr. Dog-man.

321
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,694
Tell us another story, pink cat lady.

322
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,487
Story, story!

323
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,573
Come on, everybody.
What is this, a funeral?

324
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,784
Story, story, story!

325
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,203
Well, you blew it again.

326
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,830
You really are a dweeb.

327
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,248
Don't say that.

328
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,625
Whoa, who are you?

329
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,086
Some kind of magical trash troll?

330
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:03,546
No. I'm a janitor.

331
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,257
But I was clearing out
some of the old stages,

332
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:09,594
and I found this transformation chamber.

333
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,345
Looks like a bunch of old junk.

334
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,097
Let me tell you a story.

335
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:17,810
Back in the '905, the biggest dweeb
of them all was Steve urkel.

336
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,270
Oh, yeah.

337
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:22,565
It was so funny how he never knew
whether or not he did that.

338
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:26,569
Right.
Well, nerdy Steve urkel invented a machine

339
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:30,573
that transformed him
into the debonair Stefan urquelle.

340
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,660
Mr. Janitor, you're standing next
to machine right now.

341
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,246
Yes. That's why I brought it up.

342
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,040
Now, this is just a prop.

343
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:41,626
But it represents a very powerful idea.

344
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:46,714
So if I go through that magic machine,
I'll become cool and confident?

345
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:49,634
No, it's a... it's a prop. I just said...

346
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,808
- I feel different.
- Now, son...

347
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,228
Todd? Who's Todd?

348
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,231
My name's toad. Toad chavay.

349
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,274
And I gotta get my bubble on.

350
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,653
Machine? Squirt me. Hiyah!

351
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,365
That'll do, machine.

352
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,497
Hmm.

353
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,667
Look at all this
horsin' around fan correspondence

354
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,710
herb received in the post. Capital!

355
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,671
Guys.

356
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:32,301
Someone already got
to herb's gold.

357
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,468
Oh, shit.

358
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:35,972
There's a bunch of fur in here.

359
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:37,348
It's bear fur.

360
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,434
I can tell. My stepdad was a bear.

361
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,813
Herb's nurse is a bear.
You think she knew about this gold?

362
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,732
Hey, listen to this letter.
I think it might be a clue.

363
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,278
Ahem. "Dear herb,
just finished reading your novel.

364
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,444
It's phenomenal.

365
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:54,323
I'm jealous. I wish I wrote it.

366
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,326
Sincerely, Henry winkler,

367
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,954
the guy from that one episode
of law & order: Svu."

368
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,497
Herb wrote a novel?

369
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,210
You look thin. Did you get into crossfit?

370
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:07,670
No, Sarah Lynn, I'm dying.

371
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:11,340
Whatever it is, it is super slimming.
I am for totes jeal over here.

372
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,675
It's rectal cancer.

373
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,677
Ew! Some of us are eating.

374
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,722
Look, ahem, the reason I called you
is because I need a favor.

375
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,640
Want me to leak a nude pic for charity?

376
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,976
I want you to sober up.

377
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,438
First of all, rude. Second, gross.
And third, why?

378
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:29,400
I have a very important job for you,
but if you're zonked out all the time,

379
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,194
I'm not sure I can trust you
with the responsibility.

380
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,698
No! I can do it! I'll get clean tomorrow.

381
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,409
I said tomorrow, right?

382
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:41,704
I've been working on this novel.
I wanna be remembered for something.

383
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:44,915
All I ever did was that stupid sitcom
that got ripped away from me.

384
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:48,169
But now, with this book,
I have something good.

385
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:50,630
I'm telling you, this book is gold.

386
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,633
- It's my kazzaz-terpiece.
- Whoa.

387
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,678
I want you to make sure
it gets published after I die.

388
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,472
You can count on me.

389
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,849
To life, huh? It'll kill you.

390
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,353
Oh, my god, the gold is his manuscript.

391
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,356
Herb made me promise
to get it published after he died.

392
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,399
And you're just remembering this now?

393
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,944
Yeah, I'm remembering a lot of stuff.
The ketamine's wearing off.

394
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:17,406
Oh, my god, you were the other kid
on horsin' around.

395
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:20,326
That's why you've been following us
around all day.

396
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:24,413
So no one's read this book
except for Henry winkler

397
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,833
- and now the book is missing?
- He must have been waiting for herb to die

398
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,503
so he could steal the book
and publish it himself.

399
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,672
But then when the cancer went
into remission...

400
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:33,838
Oh, my god.

401
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,217
Guys, I don't think
that car crash was an accident.

402
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,220
I think herb might have been murdered!

403
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:42,722
What's going on?

404
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,600
Something about a merger?

405
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:51,482
My name's toad, baby.

406
00:19:56,612 --> 00:20:00,199
Mmm. Mwah. Yeah.

407
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,952
Coolsville, daddy-o.

408
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:06,539
Oh, iookie here. Unh.

409
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:07,957
Yeah.

410
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,292
Yo! That's my bike!

411
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,629
Oops. Did I do that?

412
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:21,679
Damn. I know I should be mad,
but that guy's just so cool.

413
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,140
And when the river finally stopped,

414
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,809
herb went over
to a poor little ottawan boy

415
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,978
and he said, "son, you have water now."

416
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,523
You know, a lot of people go their
whole lives and they never give a damn.

417
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:36,485
But herb? He gave those beavers a dam.

418
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:37,945
That was beautiful.

419
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,823
You clearly had a special relationship.

420
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,950
We were gonna sprinkle herb
over the ocean,

421
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,328
but his resting place should be
some place meaningful, don't you think?

422
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,582
Why don't you take this up to Ottawa
and spread his ashes there.

423
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:53,335
And make sure you take a video,
and I'll e-mail blast it to everyone here.

424
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,629
So we can always remember
your great friendship.

425
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:56,796
Everybody, stop!

426
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,717
Henry winkler is a stone-cold killer!

427
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:02,511
What? I'm not a killer.

428
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:06,223
Unless you mean killer of gloom,
because I bring joy everywhere I go.

429
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,310
Did you mean "killer of gloom
because I bring joy everywhere I go"?

430
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:10,811
You know that's not what I meant.

431
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,658
You murdered herb so you could
publish his book under your own name.

432
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:17,276
But we're not gonna let you steal
his legacy, Henry winkler.

433
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:20,613
I was afraid this would happen.

434
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,490
- Oh, no, he's got a gun!
- Oh, no!

435
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:23,656
What?

436
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:29,580
No, I have herb's book.

437
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:34,210
I didn't kill herb,
but I did steal his manuscript.

438
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,170
- So that I could burn it.
- What?

439
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:38,422
Because it's terrible.

440
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:39,673
Well, I'll see for myself.

441
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,303
"The air in 18305 California was fragrant
with the flowers of laughter

442
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,721
and the smoke of adventure.“

443
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,264
- what?
- Huh.

444
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:51,977
After he died, Tina and I agreed
we couldn't let the book get published.

445
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,688
It would have turned herb
into a laughingstock.

446
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,732
"The carpenter's boy was a hungry boy.

447
00:21:56,899 --> 00:22:00,611
Hungry for crumpets.
But also hungry, dot, dot, dot, for life."

448
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:02,571
He literally wrote out "dot, dot, dot."

449
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:06,408
I know there's no accounting for taste,
but come on.

450
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:11,455
He's right. Herb wanted a legacy,
but he already has one.

451
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:14,792
People loved horsin' around.
This would only ruin that.

452
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:18,754
I'm sorry I accused you of murder,
American TV legend Henry winkler.

453
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:20,589
No need to apologize.

454
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,634
You ascribed a mystery to herb's death
to give it meaning.

455
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:25,636
But there is no meaning in death.

456
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:28,222
That's why it's so terrifying.

457
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:31,308
It was just easier to believe
that you killed him for his book

458
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,853
than believe that he just died
for nothing.

459
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,522
There is no shame in dying for nothing.

460
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,190
That's why most people die.

461
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:41,569
I just wanted to fix things somehow.

462
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:45,406
I'm sorry, horse guy, but you can't.

463
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,329
Wow, heady stuff.

464
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,706
But let's not get distracted

465
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:56,709
from what a true friend
Princess Carolyn is.

466
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,711
Don't forget the ashes, Princess Carolyn.

467
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,547
Fantastic.

468
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,222
Hey. Special delivery.

469
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,016
Courtesy of the toad-man.

470
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:15,561
Thanks. Hey, why'd you roll up
your sleeves like that? You look weird.

471
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:16,979
Oh, I, uh...

472
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,524
Well, you know, I was...
I was trying out a new look.

473
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,818
It was... it was a dumb idea.

474
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:24,653
Yup. Whoa! Oh, no!

475
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,071
Ow. Ow!

476
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,580
- Here's your squirt, sir.
- Thank you.

477
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,663
And if that happens, I want you
to take care of each other.

478
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,458
No matter what,
we're going to stick together.

479
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:38,985
- Congratulations!
- Hey, good job.

480
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,921
- You've got a goddamn hit on your hands.
- Anyone got coke?

481
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:45,799
Abc sent us limousines
to take us to the wrap party.

482
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,719
I'm scared. I've never been in a limo.

483
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:51,513
Don't worry. We'll take care of you.

484
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,642
- Seriously, no one has coke?
- Let's go.

485
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,560
You don't wanna go to the party?

486
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:57,727
No.

487
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,897
Hey, we never got a chance
to walk around the lot.

488
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:02,584
Wanna check out that water tank
where they filmed the love boat?

489
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:06,862
Are you kidding? I've always wanted
to get tanked in a tank.

490
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,784
- Quiet. Be careful. Ow.
- Oh, okay, okay.

491
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:13,994
You ready?

492
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,582
- Whoa. What?
- What...? The water's only two inches deep.

493
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:20,501
Well, that's Hollywood for you.

494
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,257
Are you scared at all?

495
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:30,427
That if the show takes off,
everything's going to change?

496
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:34,807
Heh, heh. No, I'm not scared, bj.
The future is bright.

497
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,017
Just look at it.

498
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,230
J“ back in the '905 j“

499
