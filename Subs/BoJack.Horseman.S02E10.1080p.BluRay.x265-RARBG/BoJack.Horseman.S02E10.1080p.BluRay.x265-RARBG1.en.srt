1
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,267
Aw, she looks so peaceful.

2
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:20,229
You think she's dreaming
she's not overstaying her welcome?

3
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,397
When she got that wine delivered
to the house,

4
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:25,359
I thought that was her thank-you present,
that she was leaving,

5
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:28,153
- but then she just drank the wine.
- Five days ago.

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,780
- Morning, everybody.
- Aah! Kinko!

7
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:33,158
Another beautiful day
in the city of brotherly angels.

8
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:36,620
Todd, I don't recall
accidentally ingesting poison,

9
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:38,789
and yet here you are
trying to make me vomit.

10
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:41,542
You wanna go buy me a kite
and then fly a kite?

11
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,460
No. Kites are sky trash.

12
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:48,257
Why is it so daytime right now?

13
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:49,423
Wanda?

14
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:53,637
Wanna go surf some cloud waves?
That's what I call wind.

15
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,639
Sorry. Some of us have jobs.

16
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:58,016
Not all of us. Just some of us.

17
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,185
Oh, yeah, my job.

18
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:03,313
- Morning.
- What?

19
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,067
I'm done with my sabbatical
and I'm ready to get back to work.

20
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:08,652
What sabbatical? I fired you.

21
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:11,196
Oh, I thought
when you said, "you're fired,"

22
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:14,074
that was just you
"giving me the business."

23
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,410
No, I was taking the "business"
away from you.

24
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,831
Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.
You wanna go fly a kite?

25
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,208
Put me down
for a supersized "sounds great."

26
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:26,461
But with an even larger main course
of "sadly I cannot."

27
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:30,340
I am swamped here at work.
First I gotta put my suit on.

28
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,134
Then I gotta go to hair and makeup.

29
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:33,677
Then we record the show.

30
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:36,096
And then I gotta take my suit off.

31
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:39,141
So, that's like the whole day. Sorry.

32
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:44,730
Aah.

33
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,148
"Looking for a friend?"

34
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:47,357
Yes.

35
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,692
"Need direction?"

36
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,235
I'm listening.

37
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:52,529
"Try scientology"?

38
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,573
- Huh.
- Excuse me? Sir?

39
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,907
- Huh?
- Have you ever thought

40
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:58,368
about trying improv comedy?

41
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:02,164
Improv comedy? I don't know...

42
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:04,541
Why not?
It's not like there's anything else to do.

43
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,168
Here on Mars.

44
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:07,502
We're on Mars?

45
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:12,299
Yes. And in a martian ice cream shop.
Care for a butterscotch swirl?

46
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,466
Whoa!

47
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:16,094
The only limit is my imagination.

48
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,764
Why not come by our theater
and try a free class?

49
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,893
Okay!
Can I bring this food inside the theater?

50
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,686
Ha, good one.

51
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,230
- But no.
- Oh.

52
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,707
"That's when I learned
that guns can blow a vato away.

53
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:30,919
But calculus?
Calculus can blow a mind away."

54
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,337
Cut!

55
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:33,504
We got it!

56
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,173
That's the day, everybody.

57
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:40,178
- You sure we got it, Abe?
- Of course. You were phenomenal.

58
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,265
Really? Because that kid sneezed
in the middle of my monologue.

59
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,851
- We can fix that in post.
- Abe, I'm supposed to tell you

60
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,769
the boom Mike fell into the last shot.

61
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,647
You sure you don't wanna get another take?
Just for safety?

62
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:53,650
What am I, kubrick?
We can fix all this stuff in post.

63
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,652
It's an easy scene.

64
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:59,906
Secretariat's a nice guy,
the Spanish kids learn a lesson.

65
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,533
Boom. Bam! Done!

66
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,703
But secretariat never actually taught math
in south central.

67
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,623
I don't know what secretariat did
or didn't do. I wasn't there.

68
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,585
- Yeah, but...
- Okay, so the studio wants gangbangers,

69
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:12,961
we'll give them gangbangers.

70
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,422
- We get paid either way, right?
- I guess.

71
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,592
I can't wait to get home.
I got a coq au vin in the slow cooker.

72
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:19,885
You like coq au vin?

73
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,971
I think so. Is that the move
where a French girl pours soup in...

74
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,556
Come over for dinner, okay?

75
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:25,932
- You'll love it.
- Okay.

76
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,478
Chin up, big guy.
So, we ain't making Casablanca.

77
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,692
- Bojack. Shut up.
- Aah! What are you...?

78
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,319
No one can know I'm here.

79
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,362
- What?
- Shut your stupid mouth, you idiot.

80
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,407
As you know, you're my favorite client.

81
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:45,243
If I left vigor,
would you follow me to a new agency?

82
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,038
Sure, but no one's gonna hire me
after this movie comes out.

83
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,666
The script turned into a piece of shit,
and the director is a total hack.

84
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:52,959
Good guy, total hack.

85
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,504
Let's get you something
before the movie comes out.

86
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,548
We got an offer in for this new play
off-Broadway.

87
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,425
Theater? That's what real actors do.

88
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:02,928
Yeah, I told them that,
but they said she wanted you.

89
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,555
- She?
- Yeah, this hot new playwright Jill pill.

90
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,432
- She came out of nowhere.
- Jill pill?

91
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,851
New York magazine called her
the enfant terrible

92
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,478
of the immersive theater world,

93
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,897
and then later clarified
that that's a compliment.

94
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,608
It sounds like the kind of thing
I should be doing now.

95
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:19,903
- Something artistic and bold.
- Rehearsals start in two weeks.

96
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,322
Are you ready to go to New York
for six months?

97
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,908
New York's a great city to live in
for six months

98
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:28,537
and not a second longer and only
if you're insanely wealthy. I can't wait!

99
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,708
Now, that's a lot of apple sauce.

100
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,627
A pple sauce'

101
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:36,795
aah!

102
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,046
That was so funny.

103
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,632
Which one of you guys
wrote all those funny jokes?

104
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:45,053
No, Todd, here at shenanigags,
we make things up on the spot.

105
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:48,390
- Let's try it. Give me a suggestion.
- Uh... I don't know.

106
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:49,599
Suggesfions?

107
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,686
Your suggestion was "suggestions."

108
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,564
- Way to break the fourth wall.
- That wasn't that funny.

109
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,608
My name's Bryan
and you haven't won me over yet.

110
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,402
- Oh, Bryan.
- Todd, in improv,

111
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,613
we get suggestions from an audience
then make up scenes based on them.

112
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,325
There are just a few simple rules.
You don't ask questions. You don't say no.

113
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:11,413
No matter what. When someone makes a
suggestion, you always try to build on it.

114
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,373
We call that "yes, and..."

115
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,752
Yes, and if you mess up, that's okay.
It's all part of the fun.

116
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,421
Is it really that simple?

117
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:22,966
It's incredibly complicated
and requires years of training.

118
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,133
Oh, Bryan.

119
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:30,015
But improv isn't just about a constant
clamoring for attention and validation.

120
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,181
It's about community.

121
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,727
I've always wanted to be part
of a community.

122
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,438
Well, you are now.
Your first class is $200.

123
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,356
I thought you said it was free.

124
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,984
Oh, that was just me doing an improv.

125
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,364
I am so proud of you.

126
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,784
Every day I'm telling people all about
the great stuff you're doing there.

127
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,913
- Yeah, I don't know...
- And they say, "wow, she sounds amazing."

128
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,790
And I say, "I'm here to confirm
she is an incredible woman."

129
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,709
- Well...
- You know, the sound guy's wife

130
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,085
works with at-risk teens.

131
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:03,089
And I was like, "yeah, that's okay,
but compared to what my wife is doing,

132
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,883
- your wife is bullshit!"
- Oh.

133
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,509
And he had to agree with me.

134
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,428
.Um.- -because I am his boss.

135
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,805
- Listen...
- Let me talk to one of the locals.

136
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:14,643
I wanna hear someone else talk
about how what a selfless hero my wife is.

137
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,561
- Oh, uh...
- Ah, now come on.

138
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:19,731
- Most refugees got their tongues cut out.
- Find one with a tongue.

139
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,483
- I don't think...
- Indulge me.

140
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,442
Okay.

141
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,862
"Hello. I am refugee from village."

142
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,949
Hey, what's your name, superstar?

143
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:32,035
Uh, my name is...

144
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,998
Coffee maker.

145
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,877
Ah. Kofi makir.
Am I pronouncing that right?

146
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:47,509
Hey, Todd, you had some killer provs
in class today.

147
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:50,762
Yes, and that zombie dentist scene
was so innovative.

148
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,723
- Oh, Bryan.
- Guys, look.

149
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:54,975
It's copernicus.

150
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,936
- Who's that?
- What are you, new?

151
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,604
Yes, I am new.

152
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,982
Copernicus is the founder of shenanigags.

153
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,567
That guy is the jan-ove waldner
of modern improv.

154
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,654
- Who is jan-ove waldner?
- The Michael Jordan of table tennis.

155
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,865
- Let's go talk to him.
- Are you kidding?

156
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,993
You can't just go up and talk
to copernicus.

157
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,996
Man, Todd, you don't know shit.
You're just a tourist.

158
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,162
No, I'm not.

159
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:20,166
If you're one of us, prove it.
Go improv that lady over there.

160
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:21,792
Freestyle.

161
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,753
No audience, no net.

162
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,506
- I don't know...
- Hey, if you're down with the prov,

163
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:27,757
you gotta prove that prov.

164
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,093
All right. I'll do it.

165
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:34,639
- Hello, old ma'am.
- Oh, hello.

166
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:38,518
I'm just waiting for my friend Doris.
Have you seen her?

167
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:39,519
Yes,

168
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,647
and she exploded?

169
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,524
Doris exploded?

170
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,943
- You just got prov'd!
- In your face, lady!

171
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,111
The streets are ours!

172
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,573
- Hurray, improv! I did it!
- You have briefly won me over.

173
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,244
Poor Doris...

174
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,583
That is not what I thought coq au vin was.
But it's great.

175
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,711
Well, I'm no emeril lagasse,
but we do get by.

176
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,130
Oh sto, p.

177
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,174
Like emeril? Ha, remember that?

178
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,133
He said bam.

179
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,844
I don't know who emeril is,
but he sounds delightful.

180
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:14,637
Hey, should I give him a sitcom?

181
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,807
Bojack, Abe tells me
you guys are almost done with the movie.

182
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,809
One week left!

183
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,771
You two lovebirds gonna do
any traveling or anything?

184
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,024
I'll be traveling back and forth
to New York for the next few months

185
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,818
because bojack's doing a play there
after you finish.

186
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,111
- Oh, I love plays.
- A play.

187
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,822
That's my favorite place
to eat crinkly candies.

188
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,825
Yeah, I can't wait to finally work
on something good, you know?

189
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,242
Oh?

190
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:40,955
Although I gotta hand it to your husband.
It has been a really painless shoot,

191
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,322
even though the movie's gonna be
a piece of shit, right?

192
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,294
- What?
- Oh, you said "piece of ship," right?

193
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:47,712
Like shipshape?

194
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,964
Anyway, what were we talking about?
Who knows?

195
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,841
- Okay, moving on.
- Hey, it's fine.

196
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,218
Abe knows what we're making.

197
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,010
Right?

198
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,849
- Wanda, would you help me with dessert?
- Uh, okay.

199
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:05,146
Yeah.
New York is so great in the summer,

200
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,650
but I don't think
we're going to be done in time.

201
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,860
We're looking at a ton of reshoots.

202
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,737
- Are you kidding?
- Well, you know,

203
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:15,865
because the movie's such a piece of shit
and all.

204
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,408
Did that hurt your feelings?

205
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:20,245
I mean, you're the one who said
we're not making Casablanca.

206
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:24,666
Right, because Casablanca is a movie
about a club owner named Rick.

207
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,168
This movie's about secretariat,
a racehorse.

208
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:32,715
Wait, you literally meant we're not making
the actual movie Casablanca?

209
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:36,678
That movie already exists.
Why would we make Casablanca?

210
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:40,306
- This is a different movie.
- I think there was a misunderstanding.

211
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,726
Wrong, boy-o.
There was a mister-understanding.

212
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:47,272
And that mister is me
understanding you just fine.

213
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,941
You come into my home
and you call my work shit?

214
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,943
- You know what I think, you're shit.
- What?

215
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,071
You think I don't get enough takes?
I'll get more takes.

216
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,699
Just wait, see how many takes I can get.

217
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,871
Well, don't go.
We haven't had dessert yet.

218
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,415
Shirley's lemon merengue? Mwah.

219
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:08,251
I mean, it's no banana cream pie.

220
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,379
Because it's a different kind of pie?

221
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,756
That's right.

222
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,844
Why did you have to antagonize him?

223
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,679
I wasn't trying to antagonize him.

224
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,974
- He said, "it's no Casablanca."
- Well, what's done is done.

225
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,435
You're happy.
You didn't want me to go to New York.

226
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,020
Lucky me, I get to stay here

227
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,439
and work on this movie
that's gonna ruin my career.

228
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,733
There's no reason to sulk about it, right?

229
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,069
Or you could sulk about it.

230
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,821
Diane does raise some good points.

231
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:37,780
No, she doesn't.

232
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:41,951
Besides, I don't think Diane's the person
you wanna be going to for life advice now.

233
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,330
Why? Just because I've been drinking
myself to sleep on your deck chairs

234
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:49,667
and lying to my husband for the last week?
Hey, there's a cheez-it on the shelf.

235
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,920
I knew I kept these things around
for a reason.

236
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:57,050
- I just had the most amazing prov sesh.
- No one cares, Todd.

237
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,886
Hey, you guys wanna help me practice?
Make a suggestion.

238
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,680
- Stop.
- Aah. Sorry, officer,

239
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,016
I didn't see that stop sign.

240
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:06,434
Yes.

241
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:07,936
And my car runs on farts.

242
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,022
- Stop. No, stop it.
- Please stop.

243
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,232
Not a suggestion.

244
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:16,778
Okay.
I just hope I impress the elder council.

245
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,404
I want to become a level two,

246
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:23,284
so I can finally achieve clarity
on the mainstage with the chosen ones.

247
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,245
Oh, shit, Todd's in a cult.

248
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,872
What? No, improv is not a cult.

249
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,832
It's just a dogmatic school of thought

250
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,001
taught by a for-profit organization

251
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,963
with the promise of social
and professional opportunities.

252
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,507
It's a cult. And I know.

253
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,886
I learned a little about cults
during that year I was a scientologist.

254
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,740
Cause coincidentally during that year,
I happened to read a book about cults.

255
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,724
Wait, are you saying
scientology is a cult?

256
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,727
No, scientology is not a cult.

257
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,229
Improv is a cult.

258
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:55,191
I wanna be very clear.
This is about improv.

259
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:58,903
- I really don't think it's that bad, guys.
- Why does anything matter, right?

260
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,114
Love is an illusion,
and happiness is fleeting,

261
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,534
no such thing as god, and all your
favorite musicians beat their wives.

262
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,786
Allegedly.

263
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,412
Would you talk to her?

264
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:09,538
Yes.

265
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:13,543
Yes, and I am a Nazi Kardashian.

266
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,296
Hey, Hitler.

267
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,462
Please stop.

268
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:23,928
President Lohan!
Get away from that fire hose!

269
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,263
Fire hose!

270
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,223
Sorry I'm late, guys!

271
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,268
Todd, we take tardiness seriously here
at shenanigags.

272
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:34,939
- If you miss one more class, you're out.
- I'm sorry. But, wait, Bryan isn't here.

273
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:38,067
- He's later than I am.
- Bryan's not gonna be at practice anymore.

274
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,904
He's been negative, so copernicus thought
he could benefit from some time away.

275
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:45,450
He's been reassigned to the shenanigags
comedy cruise line, the giggleship.

276
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,162
- Is that a reward or a punishment?
- That's up to Bryan.

277
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,497
Let's have no more questions
about the giggleship.

278
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,333
Oh, uh, all right.

279
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,336
Well, you know,
I was actually talking to my best friend,

280
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,547
and he said improv is a cult.

281
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,507
I mean, that's crazy, right?

282
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,932
If you think shenanigags is a cult,
you're free to go, Todd.

283
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,477
Oh, no. I don't wanna go.
I love this place.

284
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:15,605
My friend just doesn't know
how great you guys are.

285
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,483
It sounds like your friend's
not yes-and'ing you.

286
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,318
Invite him to your graduation show.

287
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:23,946
If he's too negative to support you,
you should take a good hard think

288
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,532
about if that's the kind of energy
you want in your life.

289
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:30,286
I hate good hard thinks.

290
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,209
I love you, too, Mr. Peanutbutter.
But I... I gotta go.

291
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:39,212
I'm...
Yeah, I'm building a school for deaf kids.

292
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,090
The kids get jealous
if I'm talking on the phone.

293
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,299
Uh, okay, bye.

294
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:44,634
So, hey, hi.

295
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:47,970
How long are you thinking of staying here?
Just for my own reference.

296
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,140
Oh, shit.
Is Wanda making you get rid of me?

297
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,850
No one is making me do anything.

298
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,019
Except keep acting in this movie you hate.

299
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:56,186
Well, yeah.

300
00:14:56,938 --> 00:15:00,983
I really thought I could do it. I thought
I could go far away and help people

301
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,403
and be this best possible version
of myself.

302
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,569
And what happened?

303
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,197
I couldn't.

304
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,491
I wasn't the person I thought I was.

305
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,661
I'd love to stay and wallow with you,
but I gotta head out.

306
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:15,540
Today we're filming what used to be the
scene where secretariat commits suicide,

307
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:18,251
but is now a scene where he swims
in a fishing hole

308
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,003
- with his girlfriend "susie side."
- Yeesh.

309
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,215
If you wanna blow off work,
I'm probably just gonna sit on the couch,

310
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,968
drink beer, and watch old episodes
of horsin'around.

311
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,135
Hmm.

312
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,347
And if I hear one more peep out of you...

313
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,686
- Sabrina!
- What? I didn't peep!

314
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,938
Oh!

315
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,525
Sabrina was such a little bitch.

316
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:45,153
She was an orphan. She had a tough life.

317
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,698
Hey, Diane, you're still here.
And bojack is here.

318
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,032
Did you go to work today?

319
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,618
I was gonna, but then I remembered
everything is garbage,

320
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,162
so why bother doing anything?

321
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,372
- True story.
- Okay.

322
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,332
Oh, you didn't.

323
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,502
Oh, you did.

324
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,676
- Hello.
- Hey, could you get the door?

325
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,343
-Whoa.

326
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,306
The property's gonna be ready in June.
Gives us two months

327
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,391
to get everything we need
out of this place.

328
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:16,309
Mm. Perfect.

329
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,395
Just so you know, I had to register
the corporation in your name.

330
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,481
- What?
- Just until the divorce is finalized.

331
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,025
Katie's lawyers are watching me closely
right now.

332
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:24,984
They're hawks.

333
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,153
I mean, not literally.
Well, one literally.

334
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,238
Know what, actually, he might be a falcon.

335
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,405
Rutabaga, this is too...

336
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,783
This is a temporary technicality,
I promise.

337
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:35,453
I'm not gonna leave you holding the bag.
Okay?

338
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,412
Mm. Mm.

339
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:39,123
Hey, your assistant wasn't out there,
so I just... ooh.

340
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,958
- Oh, hello.
- Look at this urn.

341
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,585
What's going on in here?

342
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,378
Mr. Peanutbutter, shut the door.

343
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:49,717
Rutabaga and I are starting a new agency,
and we want you to come with us.

344
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:53,054
Well, well, well, what delicious irony.

345
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:56,349
It appears the cat is chasing the dog.

346
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:57,517
Are you in or out?

347
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:58,476
Are you kidding?

348
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:01,729
You're the agent who got me
hollywoo stars and celebrities.

349
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,264
- Well...
- What do they know?

350
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,837
- Right, so...
- Do they know things?

351
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,234
- Okay...
- Let's find out.

352
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,568
- Right...
- Big fan.

353
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,028
I like you guys.

354
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,531
I like your hustle
and I like your matching lipstick.

355
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,157
- Well, um...
- I am in.

356
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:14,325
Mm-hm.

357
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,080
Go home, goober.

358
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:20,247
Yeah! Go home, goober!

359
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,209
Goober sucks.
Why doesn't he ever go home?

360
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,294
Yeah, goober's the one who should go home.

361
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,547
- You suck, goober!
- Hey, goober! Get murdered!

362
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,132
Go sit on a sharp click, you piece of shit.

363
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:32,677
- Hey, guys.
- Shut up, Todd.

364
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,263
Bojack, listen, I... oh!

365
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,557
- Hey, whoa!
- Boo! Party foul!

366
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,809
- You knocked over bucking-can palace.
- Come on!

367
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,727
Uh, sorry, I'll clean that up later.

368
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,481
Listen to this guy, "clean it up later."
Hasn't picked up his shit in years.

369
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:46,774
Clean up your shit, Todd.

370
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:51,612
Bojack, I wanted to invite you
to my graduation show tomorrow night.

371
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,573
- What?
- Look, I know you think

372
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,784
it's just a dumb cult,
but you're my best friend

373
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,537
and it would really mean a lot
if you came.

374
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:04,292
I'm gonna go down to the basement
to practice my space work.

375
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:08,421
And here I am going downstairs.

376
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:11,549
Hello?

377
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:15,636
- What kind of pants are you wearing now?
- What? I don't know. The normal kind.

378
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,598
Yeah? Mm. Are they comfy?
A comfy pair of pants?

379
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,308
I guess. Why?

380
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,602
Just wondering
what kind of hit you're gonna take

381
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:26,272
when the studio sues the pants off you
for breach of contract.

382
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,108
They're suing me?
Also, are you wearing comfortable shoes?

383
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,503
Because that was a long road to walk
to get to that punch line.

384
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,613
- This is serious.
- We're not just doing bits?

385
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,448
You started it with the pants thing.

386
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:39,160
You need to go back to set.
You can't just not go to work.

387
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,330
Remember, you wanted this.

388
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:49,253
You're saying you're finally ready
to settle down with yours truly?

389
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,672
Darn tootin'.
I may be a professional racehorse,

390
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,466
but I'm tired of running in circles.

391
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:54,425
Cut!

392
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:57,219
Perfect,
but let's get that last part again.

393
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:02,266
- Anything you want me to do differently?
- No, I just think we should get it again.

394
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:04,185
You know, for safety.

395
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:07,146
- Action!
- I'm tired of running in circles.

396
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:08,731
And again?

397
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,524
I'm tired of running in circles.

398
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,194
Why don't we get it like five more times?

399
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:15,154
I'm tired of running in circles.

400
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,323
I'm tired of running in circles.

401
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,492
I'm tired of running in circles.

402
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,661
I'm tired of running in circles.

403
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,704
I'm tired of running in circles.

404
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,915
Let's get it 10 more times.

405
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,546
- Ta-da!
- We did it.

406
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,882
- What now?
- We die, have our guts ripped out

407
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,885
through our noses,
and get enshrined inside of it. Duh.

408
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,179
Hey, bojack,
can I talk to you for a minute?

409
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,390
Ooh...

410
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:43,557
Alone, please?

411
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,771
So, good news. We're gonna go on a trip.

412
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,356
- Right now. You and me.
- What?

413
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:53,442
I booked us a room for the weekend.
Pack your bags, let's go.

414
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,610
Where? Why?

415
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:55,945
Less asking, more basking.

416
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,239
In the sun, that is. Santa Barbara.

417
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,825
- I'm not really in the mood for...
- I think some time away

418
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,494
could be really good for us, as a couple.

419
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:07,248
I know you've been really bummed out
about the movie,

420
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:11,210
but I don't think moping around the house
with Diane all day is healthy.

421
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,938
All I've ever wanted
was to be in this movie,

422
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,922
and you just want me
to put on a happy face...

423
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,592
Yes. There are lots of people
who don't like their jobs.

424
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,803
Doesn't mean
they've to bring it home with...

425
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,515
- Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
- What is that supposed to mean?

426
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,767
Well, come on.
You're a network executive.

427
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,602
You don't give a shit about work.

428
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,522
I actually have a lot of pride
in what I do.

429
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,023
What? You have a lot of pride?

430
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:35,609
Your job is to pump out garbage every year

431
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,362
hoping some of the garbage
stinks less than the rest

432
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:41,615
so you can quietly renew that garbage
and keep failing sideways

433
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,368
until you retire
to a three-point-five bedroom garbage

434
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,388
in Beverly garbage and
spend the rest of your life

435
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:50,458
- watching your former assistants' garbage.
- I don't know where this is coming from.

436
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:53,461
Every good thing
that ever happened to you happened

437
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,629
because of network executives like me.

438
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,716
That show you spend all day watching,
your house, your career...

439
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:02,470
Great house, great career, great life!
Must be why I'm so happy all the time!

440
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,929
- You don't know...
- I don't?

441
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,767
My life was ruined by a network executive
like you.

442
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:11,812
Well, I'm sorry
that things have been so hard for you,

443
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:15,775
but that doesn't give you the right to be
shitty to me. I can't be around someone

444
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,778
who's just fueled
by bitterness and negativity.

445
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,405
Well then, what are you doing here?

446
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,908
What happened, bojack?

447
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,619
Same thing that always happens.

448
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:29,663
You didn't know me.
Then you fell in love with me.

449
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,707
And now you know me.

450
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,922
You know, it's funny. When you look
at someone through Rose-colored glasses,

451
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,841
all the red flags just look like flags.

452
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,809
- So, Wanda's moving out.
- Oh, shit. Because of me?

453
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,560
No. Because of me.

454
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:55,064
I'm sorry. You wanna watch another episode
of horsin'around?

455
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,692
Where Olivia does the school project
where she pretends an egg is a baby.

456
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,695
Spoiler alert:
Ethan needs to make an omelet.

457
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:03,697
Why won't you go home?

458
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,617
I should. I know I should.

459
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,620
I wish I could just go home right now
and crawl into bed

460
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:13,499
and not have to talk about anything
or explain anything.

461
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,502
He would just say, "how was your day?"
And then he would say,

462
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,547
"hey, did you know the monorail
was invented by George monorail?"

463
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,674
And I would say,
"I don't think that's true."

464
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:25,344
And he would say, "well, if he didn't
invent it, he certainly perfected it."

465
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:28,347
And I wouldn't have to say,
"I'm sorry I left.

466
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:30,432
I'm sorry I made things so difficult.

467
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:34,353
I'm sorry I'm not the person
I thought I was."

468
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:37,106
I would just say, "my day was good."

469
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,817
And he would say, "I love you."

470
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:44,154
The longer you keep lying to him,
the harder it's gonna get.

471
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,448
Can I ask you something?

472
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,952
That play in New York,
would that really have made you happy?

473
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,997
Yeah. I mean, for a little bit.

474
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,623
And if Kelsey didn't get fired,

475
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,917
and you got to make the movie
you wanted to make,

476
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,669
would that have made you happy?

477
00:22:58,836 --> 00:22:59,962
For a little bit.

478
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:01,422
But then...

479
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,007
Probably...

480
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,051
So, what does it matter?

481
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:09,013
But there has to be more.

482
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:13,392
Well, when's the last time
you were actually happy?

483
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,990
You microchipped my penis? Check, please!

484
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:29,408
Microchip.

485
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:49,844
Todd!

486
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:53,724
Yeah.

487
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:00,564
Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

488
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:02,232
Hey. How are you?

489
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,443
I can't do this anymore.

490
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,570
You can't do what anymore?

491
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:09,198
I can't talk to you on the phone
all the time.

492
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,616
It's too hard.

493
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,534
Uh, have you tried Bluetooth?

494
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,663
I think maybe we should stop
calling each other, for a little bit.

495
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,832
I'm sorry. I just miss you too much.

496
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,835
But listen, I love you. Okay?

497
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,087
Mr. Peanutbutter?

498
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:26,465
Uh, yeah. Uh, okay.

499
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:27,675
I love you, Diane.

500
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,761
- Where is he?
- I don't know, sir.

501
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:33,681
Can't do this to me. Where the hell is he?

502
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:47,945
If you come to find out who you are

503
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:54,201
and may you find out
may you find out who you are

504
00:24:56,745 --> 00:25:00,833
and if you come to search
for what is love

505
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:07,214
then may you find it
may you find it at any cost

506
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:13,887
go now
you'll go, but don't just hide

507
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:19,935
never leave this
never leave this town

508
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,522
of the parade
