00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:14,723
[Snoring]

2
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,267
Aw, she looks so peaceful.

3
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:20,229
You think she's dreaming
she's not overstaying her welcome?

4
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,397
When she got that wine delivered
to the house,

5
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:25,359
I thought that was her thank-you present,
that she was leaving,

6
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:28,153
- but then she just drank the wine.
- Five days ago.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,780
- Morning, everybody.
- Aah! Kinko!

8
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:33,158
Another beautiful day
in the city of brotherly angels.

9
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:36,620
Todd, I don't recall
accidentally ingesting poison,

10
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:38,789
and yet here you are
trying to make me vomit.

11
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:41,542
You wanna go buy me a kite
and then fly a kite?

12
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,460
No. Kites are sky trash.

13
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:48,257
[Groans]
Why is it so daytime right now?

14
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:49,216
Wanda?

15
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,425
[Groaning]

16
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:53,637
Wanna go surf some cloud waves?
That's what I call wind.

17
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,639
Sorry. Some of us have jobs.

18
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:58,016
Not all of us. Just some of us.

19
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,185
Oh, yeah, my job.

20
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:03,313
- Morning.
- [Jerome] What?

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,067
I'm done with my sabbatical
and I'm ready to get back to work.

22
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:08,652
What sabbatical? I fired you.

23
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:11,196
Oh, I thought
when you said, "you're fired,"

24
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:14,074
that was just you
"giving me the business."

25
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,410
No, I was taking the "business"
away from you.

26
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,831
Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.
You wanna go fly a kite?

27
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,208
Put me down
for a supersized "sounds great."

28
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:26,461
But with an even larger main course
of "sadly I cannot."

29
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:30,340
I am swamped here at work.
First I gotta put my suit on.

30
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,134
Then I gotta go to hair and makeup.

31
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:33,677
Then we record the show.

32
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:36,096
And then I gotta take my suit off.

33
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:39,141
So, that's like the whole day. Sorry.

34
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:40,809
[Groans]

35
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,144
[Groans]

36
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:44,730
Aah.

37
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,148
"Looking for a friend?"

38
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:47,357
Yes.

39
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,692
"Need direction?"

40
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,235
I'm listening.

41
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:52,529
"Try scientology"?

42
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,573
- Huh.
- Excuse me? Sir?

43
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,907
- Huh?
- Have you ever thought

44
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:58,368
about trying improv comedy?

45
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:02,164
Improv comedy? I don't know...

46
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:04,541
Why not?
It's not like there's anything else to do.

47
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,168
Here on Mars.

48
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:07,502
We're on Mars?

49
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:12,299
Yes. And in a martian ice cream shop.
Care for a butterscotch swirl?

50
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,466
Whoa!

51
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:16,094
The only limit is my imagination.

52
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,764
Why not come by our theater
and try a free class?

53
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,893
Okay!
Can I bring this food inside the theater?

54
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,686
Ha, good one.

55
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,230
- But no.
- Oh.

56
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,707
"That's when I learned
that guns can blow a vato away.

57
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:30,919
But calculus?
Calculus can blow a mind away."

58
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,337
[Abe] Cut!

59
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:33,504
We got it!

60
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,173
That's the day, everybody.

61
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,340
[Slurping]

62
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:40,178
- You sure we got it, Abe?
- Of course. You were phenomenal.

63
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,265
Really? Because that kid sneezed
in the middle of my monologue.

64
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,851
- We can fix that in post.
- Abe, I'm supposed to tell you

65
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,769
the boom Mike fell into the last shot.

66
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,647
You sure you don't wanna get another take?
Just for safety?

67
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:53,650
What am I, kubrick?
We can fix all this stuff in post.

68
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,652
It's an easy scene.

69
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:59,906
Secretariat's a nice guy,
the Spanish kids learn a lesson.

70
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,533
Boom. Bam! Done!

71
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,703
But secretariat never actually taught math
in south central.

72
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,623
I don't know what secretariat did
or didn't do. I wasn't there.

73
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,585
- Yeah, but...
- Okay, so the studio wants gangbangers,

74
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:12,961
we'll give them gangbangers.

75
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,422
- We get paid either way, right?
- I guess.

76
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,592
I can't wait to get home.
I got a coq au vin in the slow cooker.

77
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:19,885
You like coq au vin?

78
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,971
I think so. Is that the move
where a French girl pours soup in...

79
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,556
Come over for dinner, okay?

80
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:25,932
- You'll love it.
- Okay.

81
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,478
Chin up, big guy.
So, we ain't making Casablanca.

82
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,563
[Slurping]

83
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,692
- Bojack. Shut up.
- Aah! What are you...?

84
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,319
No one can know I'm here.

85
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,362
- What?
- Shut your stupid mouth, you idiot.

86
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,407
As you know, you're my favorite client.

87
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:45,243
If I left vigor,
would you follow me to a new agency?

88
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,038
Sure, but no one's gonna hire me
after this movie comes out.

89
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,666
The script turned into a piece of shit,
and the director is a total hack.

90
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:52,959
Good guy, total hack.

91
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,504
Let's get you something
before the movie comes out.

92
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,548
We got an offer in for this new play
off-Broadway.

93
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,425
Theater? That's what real actors do.

94
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:02,928
Yeah, I told them that,
but they said she wanted you.

95
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,555
- She?
- Yeah, this hot new playwright Jill pill.

96
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,432
- She came out of nowhere.
- Jill pill?

97
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,851
New York magazine called her
the enfant terrible

98
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,478
of the immersive theater world,

99
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,897
and then later clarified
that that's a compliment.

100
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,608
It sounds like the kind of thing
I should be doing now.

101
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:19,903
- Something artistic and bold.
- Rehearsals start in two weeks.

102
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,322
Are you ready to go to New York
for six months?

103
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,908
New York's a great city to live in
for six months

104
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:28,537
and not a second longer and only
if you're insanely wealthy. I can't wait!

105
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,708
Now, that's a lot of apple sauce.

106
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,627
[All] A pple sauce'

107
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:36,795
aah!

108
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,046
That was so funny.

109
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,632
Which one of you guys
wrote all those funny jokes?

110
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:45,053
No, Todd, here at shenanigags,
we make things up on the spot.

111
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:48,390
- Let's try it. Give me a suggestion.
- Uh... I don't know.

112
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:49,599
Suggesfions?

113
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:50,559
[All laughing]

114
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,686
Your suggestion was "suggestions."

115
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,564
- Way to break the fourth wall.
- That wasn't that funny.

116
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,608
My name's Bryan
and you haven't won me over yet.

117
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,402
- Oh, Bryan.
- Todd, in improv,

118
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,613
we get suggestions from an audience
then make up scenes based on them.

119
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,325
There are just a few simple rules.
You don't ask questions. You don't say no.

120
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:11,413
No matter what. When someone makes a
suggestion, you always try to build on it.

121
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,373
We call that "yes, and..."

122
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,752
Yes, and if you mess up, that's okay.
It's all part of the fun.

123
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,421
Is it really that simple?

124
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:22,966
[Grunts] It's incredibly complicated
and requires years of training.

125
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:23,925
Oh, Bryan.

126
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,927
[All laughing]

127
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:30,015
But improv isn't just about a constant
clamoring for attention and validation.

128
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,181
It's about community.

129
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,727
I've always wanted to be part
of a community.

130
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,438
Well, you are now.
Your first class is $200.

131
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,356
I thought you said it was free.

132
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,984
Oh, that was just me doing an improv.

133
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,364
I am so proud of you.

134
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,784
Every day I'm telling people all about
the great stuff you're doing there.

135
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,913
- Yeah, I don't know...
- And they say, "wow, she sounds amazing."

136
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,790
And I say, "I'm here to confirm
she is an incredible woman."

137
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,709
- Well...
- You know, the sound guy's wife

138
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,085
works with at-risk teens.

139
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:03,089
And I was like, "yeah, that's okay,
but compared to what my wife is doing,

140
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,883
- your wife is bullshit!"
- Oh.

141
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,509
And he had to agree with me.

142
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,428
.Um.- -because I am his boss.

143
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,805
- Listen...
- Let me talk to one of the locals.

144
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:14,643
I wanna hear someone else talk
about how what a selfless hero my wife is.

145
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,561
- Oh, uh...
- Ah, now come on.

146
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:19,731
- Most refugees got their tongues cut out.
- Find one with a tongue.

147
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,483
- I don't think...
- Indulge me.

148
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,442
Okay.

149
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,862
[In lower voice]
"Hello. I am refugee from village."

150
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,949
Hey, what's your name, superstar?

151
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:32,035
Uh, my name is...

152
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,998
Coffee maker. [Groans]

153
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,877
Ah. Kofi makir.
Am I pronouncing that right?

154
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:47,509
Hey, Todd, you had some killer provs
in class today.

155
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:50,762
Yes, and that zombie dentist scene
was so innovative.

156
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,723
- Oh, Bryan.
- Guys, look.

157
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:54,975
It's copernicus.

158
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,141
[All gasp]

159
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,936
- Who's that?
- What are you, new?

160
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,604
Yes, I am new.

161
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,982
Copernicus is the founder of shenanigags.

162
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,567
That guy is the jan-ove waldner
of modern improv.

163
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,654
- Who is jan-ove waldner?
- The Michael Jordan of table tennis.

164
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,865
- Let's go talk to him.
- Are you kidding?

165
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,993
You can't just go up and talk
to copernicus.

166
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,996
Man, Todd, you don't know shit.
You're just a tourist.

167
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,162
No, I'm not.

168
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:20,166
If you're one of us, prove it.
Go improv that lady over there.

169
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:21,792
Freestyle.

170
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,753
No audience, no net.

171
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,506
- I don't know...
- Hey, if you're down with the prov,

172
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:27,757
you gotta prove that prov.

173
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,093
All right. I'll do it.

174
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:34,639
- Hello, old ma'am.
- Oh, hello.

175
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:38,518
I'm just waiting for my friend Doris.
Have you seen her?

176
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:39,519
Yes,

177
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,647
and she exploded?

178
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,524
Doris exploded?

179
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,943
- You just got prov'd!
- In your face, lady!

180
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,111
The streets are ours!

181
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,573
- Hurray, improv! I did it!
- You have briefly won me over.

182
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,244
Poor Doris...

183
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,583
That is not what I thought coq au vin was.
But it's great.

184
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,711
Well, I'm no emeril lagasse,
but we do get by.

185
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,130
-Oh sto, p. [Iau h -bam! 9 s]

186
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,174
Like emeril? Ha, remember that?

187
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,133
He said bam.

188
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,844
I don't know who emeril is,
but he sounds delightful.

189
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:14,637
Hey, should I give him a sitcom?

190
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,807
Bojack, Abe tells me
you guys are almost done with the movie.

191
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,809
One week left!

192
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,771
You two lovebirds gonna do
any traveling or anything?

193
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,024
I'll be traveling back and forth
to New York for the next few months

194
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,818
because bojack's doing a play there
after you finish.

195
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,111
- Oh, I love plays.
- A play.

196
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,822
That's my favorite place
to eat crinkly candies.

197
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,825
Yeah, I can't wait to finally work
on something good, you know?

198
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,242
Oh?

199
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:40,955
Although I gotta hand it to your husband.
It has been a really painless shoot,

200
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,322
even though the movie's gonna be
a piece of shit, right?

201
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,294
- What?
- Oh, you said "piece of ship," right?

202
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:47,712
Like shipshape? [Giggles]

203
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,964
Anyway, what were we talking about?
Who knows?

204
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,841
- Okay, moving on.
- Hey, it's fine.

205
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,218
Abe knows what we're making.

206
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:54,844
Right?

207
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,011
[Abe slurps]

208
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,849
- Wanda, would you help me with dessert?
- Uh, okay.

209
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:05,146
Yeah.
New York is so great in the summer,

210
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,650
but I don't think
we're going to be done in time.

211
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,860
We're looking at a ton of reshoots.

212
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,737
- Are you kidding?
- Well, you know,

213
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:15,865
because the movie's such a piece of shit
and all.

214
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,408
Did that hurt your feelings?

215
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:20,245
I mean, you're the one who said
we're not making Casablanca.

216
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:24,666
Right, because Casablanca is a movie
about a club owner named Rick.

217
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,168
This movie's about secretariat,
a racehorse.

218
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:32,715
Wait, you literally meant we're not making
the actual movie Casablanca?

219
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:36,678
That movie already exists.
Why would we make Casablanca?

220
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:40,306
- This is a different movie.
- I think there was a misunderstanding.

221
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,726
Wrong, boy-o.
There was a mister-understanding.

222
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:47,272
And that mister is me
understanding you just fine.

223
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,941
You come into my home
and you call my work shit?

224
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,943
- You know what I think, you're shit.
- What?

225
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,071
You think I don't get enough takes?
I'll get more takes.

226
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,699
Just wait, see how many takes I can get.

227
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,871
Well, don't go.
We haven't had dessert yet.

228
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,415
Shirley's lemon merengue? Mwah.

229
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:08,251
I mean, it's no banana cream pie.

230
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,379
Because it's a different kind of pie?

231
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,756
[Slurs] That's right.

232
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,844
Why did you have to antagonize him?

233
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,679
I wasn't trying to antagonize him.

234
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,974
- He said, "it's no Casablanca."
- Well, what's done is done.

235
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,435
You're happy.
You didn't want me to go to New York.

236
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,020
Lucky me, I get to stay here

237
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,439
and work on this movie
that's gonna ruin my career.

238
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,733
There's no reason to sulk about it, right?

239
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,069
Or you could sulk about it.

240
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,821
Diane does raise some good points.

241
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:37,780
No, she doesn't.

242
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:41,951
Besides, I don't think Diane's the person
you wanna be going to for life advice now.

243
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,330
Why? Just because I've been drinking
myself to sleep on your deck chairs

244
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:49,667
and lying to my husband for the last week?
Hey, there's a cheez-it on the shelf.

245
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,920
I knew I kept these things around
for a reason.

246
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:57,050
- I just had the most amazing prov sesh.
- No one cares, Todd.

247
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,886
Hey, you guys wanna help me practice?
Make a suggestion.

248
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,680
- Stop.
- Aah. Sorry, officer,

249
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,016
I didn't see that stop sign.

250
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:06,434
Yes.

251
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:07,936
And my car runs on farts.

252
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:08,937
[Todd mimics farting,
then Diane grunts]

253
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,022
- Stop. No, stop it.
- Please stop.

254
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,232
Not a suggestion.

255
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,191
[Mimics farting]

256
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:16,778
Okay.
I just hope I impress the elder council.

257
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,404
I want to become a level two,

258
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:23,284
so I can finally achieve clarity
on the mainstage with the chosen ones.

259
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,245
Oh, shit, Todd's in a cult.

260
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,872
What? No, improv is not a cult.

261
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,832
It's just a dogmatic school of thought

262
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,001
taught by a for-profit organization

263
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,963
with the promise of social
and professional opportunities.

264
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,507
It's a cult. And I know.

265
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,886
I learned a little about cults
during that year I was a scientologist.

266
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,740
Cause coincidentally during that year,
I happened to read a book about cults.

267
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,724
Wait, are you saying
scientology is a cult?

268
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,727
No, scientology is not a cult.

269
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,229
Improv is a cult.

270
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:55,191
I wanna be very clear.
This is about improv.

271
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:58,903
- I really don't think it's that bad, guys.
- Why does anything matter, right?

272
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,114
Love is an illusion,
and happiness is fleeting,

273
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,534
no such thing as god, and all your
favorite musicians beat their wives.

274
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,786
Allegedly.

275
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,412
Would you talk to her?

276
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:09,538
[Sighs] Yes.

277
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:13,543
Yes, and I am a Nazi Kardashian.

278
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,296
Hey, Hitler.

279
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,462
Please stop.

280
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,757
[Panting]

281
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:23,928
President Lohan!
Get away from that fire hose!

282
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,263
[All] Fire hose!

283
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,223
[Grunts] Sorry I'm late, guys!

284
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,268
Todd, we take tardiness seriously here
at shenanigags.

285
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:34,939
- If you miss one more class, you're out.
- I'm sorry. But, wait, Bryan isn't here.

286
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:38,067
- He's later than I am.
- Bryan's not gonna be at practice anymore.

287
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,904
He's been negative, so copernicus thought
he could benefit from some time away.

288
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:45,450
He's been reassigned to the shenanigags
comedy cruise line, the giggleship.

289
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,162
- Is that a reward or a punishment?
- That's up to Bryan.

290
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,497
Let's have no more questions
about the giggleship.

291
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,333
Oh, uh, all right.

292
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,336
Well, you know,
I was actually talking to my best friend,

293
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,547
and he said improv is a cult.

294
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,507
I mean, that's crazy, right?

295
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:05,511
[All laughing]

296
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,013
[Coughs]

297
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,932
If you think shenanigags is a cult,
you're free to go, Todd.

298
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,477
Oh, no. I don't wanna go.
I love this place.

299
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:15,605
My friend just doesn't know
how great you guys are.

300
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,483
It sounds like your friend's
not yes-and'ing you.

301
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,318
Invite him to your graduation show.

302
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:23,946
If he's too negative to support you,
you should take a good hard think

303
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,532
about if that's the kind of energy
you want in your life.

304
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:30,286
[Groans] I hate good hard thinks.

305
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,209
I love you, too, Mr. Peanutbutter.
But I... I gotta go.

306
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:39,212
I'm...
Yeah, I'm building a school for deaf kids.

307
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,090
The kids get jealous
if I'm talking on the phone.

308
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,299
Uh, okay, bye.

309
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:44,634
So, hey, hi.

310
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:47,970
How long are you thinking of staying here?
Just for my own reference.

311
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,140
Oh, shit.
Is Wanda making you get rid of me?

312
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,850
No one is making me do anything.

313
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,019
Except keep acting in this movie you hate.

314
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:56,186
Well, yeah.

315
00:14:56,938 --> 00:15:00,983
I really thought I could do it. I thought
I could go far away and help people

316
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,403
and be this best possible version
of myself.

317
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,569
And what happened?

318
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,197
I couldn't.

319
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,491
I wasn't the person I thought I was.

320
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,661
I'd love to stay and wallow with you,
but I gotta head out.

321
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:15,540
Today we're filming what used to be the
scene where secretariat commits suicide,

322
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:18,251
but is now a scene where he swims
in a fishing hole

323
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,003
- with his girlfriend "susie side."
- Yeesh.

324
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,215
If you wanna blow off work,
I'm probably just gonna sit on the couch,

325
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,968
drink beer, and watch old episodes
of horsin'around.

326
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,135
Hmm.

327
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,095
[Audience laughs]

328
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,347
And if I hear one more peep out of you...

329
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,266
[Crashing, then audience laughs]

330
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,686
- Sabrina!
- [Sabrina] What? I didn't peep!

331
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,938
Oh!

332
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,313
[Audience applauding]

333
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,525
Sabrina was such a little bitch.

334
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:45,153
She was an orphan. She had a tough life.

335
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,698
Hey, Diane, you're still here.
And bojack is here.

336
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,032
Did you go to work today?

337
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,618
I was gonna, but then I remembered
everything is garbage,

338
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,162
so why bother doing anything?

339
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,372
- True story.
- Okay.

340
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,332
[Secretariat] Oh, you didn't.

[Audience laughing]

342
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,502
Oh, you did.

[Sitcom theme plays over TV]

344
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,676
- Hello.
- Hey, could you get the door?

345
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,343
-Whoa.

346
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,306
The property's gonna be ready in June.
Gives us two months

347
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,391
to get everything we need
out of this place.

348
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:16,309
Mm. Perfect.

349
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,395
Just so you know, I had to register
the corporation in your name.

350
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,481
- What?
- Just until the divorce is finalized.

351
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,025
Katie's lawyers are watching me closely
right now.

352
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:24,984
They're hawks.

353
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,153
I mean, not literally.
Well, one literally.

355

Rutabaga, this is too...

356
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,783
This is a temporary technicality,
I promise.

357
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:35,453
I'm not gonna leave you holding the bag.
Okay?

358
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,412
Mm. Mm.

359
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:39,123
Hey, your assistant wasn't out there,
so I just... ooh.

360
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,958
- Oh, hello.
- Look at this urn.

What's going on in here?

362
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,378
Mr. Peanutbutter, shut the door.

363

Well, well, well, what delicious irony.

It appears the cat is chasing the dog.

366

Are you kidding?

You're the agent who got me

- Well...
- What do they know?

00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,837
- Right, so...
- Do they know things?

371

- I am in.

Mm-hm.

Go home, goober.

Yeah! Go home, goober!

Why doesn't he ever go home?

Hasn't picked up his shit in years.

to my graduation show tomorrow night.

391
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,573
- What?
- Look, I know you think

392
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,784
it's just a dumb cult,
but you're my best friend

393
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,537
and it would really mean a lot
if you came.

to practice my space work.

395
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:08,421
And here I am going downstairs.

[Cell phone ringing]

397
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:11,549
Hello?

398
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:15,636
- What kind of pants are you wearing now?
- What? I don't know. The normal kind.

399
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,598
Yeah? Mm. Are they comfy?
A comfy pair of pants?

400
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,308
I guess. Why?

401
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,602
Just wondering
what kind of hit you're gonna take

402
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:26,272
when the studio sues the pants off you
for breach of contract.

403
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,108
They're suing me?
Also, are you wearing comfortable shoes?

404
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,503
Because that was a long road to walk
to get to that punch line.

405
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,613
- This is serious.
- We're not just doing bits?

406
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,448
You started it with the pants thing.

407
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:39,160
You need to go back to set.
You can't just not go to work.

408
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:40,119

409
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,330
Remember, you wanted this.

410

You're saying you're finally ready
to settle down with yours truly?

Perfect,
but let's get that last part again.

- Anything you want me to do differently?
- No, I just think we should get it again.

416

- What now?
- We die, have our guts ripped out

430

through our noses,
and get enshrined inside of it. Duh.

- I'm not really in the mood for...
- I think some time away

441
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,494
could be really good for us, as a couple.

442
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:07,248
I know you've been really bummed out
about the movie,

443
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:11,210
but I don't think moping around the house
with Diane all day is healthy.

444
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,938
All I've ever wanted
was to be in this movie,

445
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,922
and you just want me
to put on a happy face...

446
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,592
Yes. There are lots of people
who don't like their jobs.

447
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,803
Doesn't mean
they've to bring it home with...

448
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,515
- Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
- What is that supposed to mean?

449
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,767
Well, come on.
You're a network executive.

450
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,602
You don't give a shit about work.

451
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,522
I actually have a lot of pride
in what I do.

452
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,023
What? You have a lot of pride?

453
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:35,609
Your job is to pump out garbage every year

454
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,362
hoping some of the garbage
stinks less than the rest

455
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:41,615
so you can quietly renew that garbage
and keep failing sideways

456
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,368
until you retire
to a three-point-five bedroom garbage

457
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,388
in Beverly garbage and
spend the rest of your life

458
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:50,458
- watching your former assistants' garbage.
- I don't know where this is coming from.

459
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:53,461
Every good thing
that ever happened to you happened

460
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,629
because of network executives like me.

461
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,716
That show you spend all day watching,
your house, your career...

462
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:02,470
Great house, great career, great life!
Must be why I'm so happy all the time!

463
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,929
- You don't know...
- I don't?

464
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,767
My life was ruined by a network executive
like you.

465
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:11,812
Well, I'm sorry
that things have been so hard for you,

466
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:15,775
but that doesn't give you the right to be
shitty to me. I can't be around someone

467
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,778
who's just fueled
by bitterness and negativity.

468
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,405
Well then, what are you doing here?

469
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,908
What happened, bojack?

470
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,619
Same thing that always happens.

471
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:29,663
You didn't know me.
Then you fell in love with me.

472
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,707
And now you know me.

473
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,922
You know, it's funny. When you look
at someone through Rose-colored glasses,

474
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,841
all the red flags just look like flags.

475
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,809
- So, Wanda's moving out.
- Oh, shit. Because of me?

476
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,560
No. Because of me.

477
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:55,064
I'm sorry. You wanna watch another episode
of horsin'around?

478
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,692
Where Olivia does the school project
where she pretends an egg is a baby.

479
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,695
Spoiler alert:
Ethan needs to make an omelet.

480
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:03,697
Why won't you go home?

481
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,617
I should. I know I should.

482
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,620
I wish I could just go home right now
and crawl into bed

483
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:13,499
and not have to talk about anything
or explain anything.

484
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,502
He would just say, "how was your day?"
And then he would say,

485
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,547
"hey, did you know the monorail
was invented by George monorail?"

486
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,674
And I would say,
"I don't think that's true."

487
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:25,344
And he would say, "well, if he didn't
invent it, he certainly perfected it."

488
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:28,347
And I wouldn't have to say,
"I'm sorry I left.

489
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:30,432
I'm sorry I made things so difficult.

490
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:34,353
I'm sorry I'm not the person
I thought I was."

491
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:37,106
I would just say, "my day was good."

492
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,817
And he would say, "I love you."

493
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:44,154
The longer you keep lying to him,
the harder it's gonna get.

494
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,448
Can I ask you something?

495
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,952
That play in New York,
would that really have made you happy?

496
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,997
Yeah. I mean, for a little bit.

497
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,623
And if Kelsey didn't get fired,

498
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,917
and you got to make the movie
you wanted to make,

499
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,669
would that have made you happy?

500
00:22:58,836 --> 00:22:59,962
For a little bit.

501
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:01,422
But then...

502
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,007
Probably...

503
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,051
So, what does it matter?

504
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:09,013
But there has to be more.

505
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:13,392
Well, when's the last time
you were actually happy?

506
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,990
You microchipped my penis? Check, please!

507
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:29,408
[All] Microchip.

508
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:30,951
[Laughs]

509
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,079
[Audience applauding]

510
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:36,999
[Sighs]

511
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,795
[Doorbell rings]

512
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:49,844
[All] Todd!

513
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,138
[Todd groans and all laughing]

514
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:53,724
[Laughs] Yeah.

515
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:00,564
Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

516
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:02,232
Hey. How are you?

517
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,443
I can't do this anymore.

518
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,570
You can't do what anymore?

519
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:09,198
I can't talk to you on the phone
all the time.

520
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,616
It's too hard.

521
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,534
Uh, have you tried Bluetooth?

522
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,663
I think maybe we should stop
calling each other, for a little bit.

523
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,832
I'm sorry. I just miss you too much.

524
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,835
But listen, I love you. Okay?

525
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,087
Mr. Peanutbutter?

526
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:26,465
Uh, yeah. Uh, okay.

527
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:27,675
I love you, Diane.

528
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,761
- Where is he?
- I don't know, sir.

529
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:33,681
Can't do this to me. Where the hell is he?

530
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:47,945
If you come to find out who you are

531
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:54,201
and may you find out
may you find out who you are

532
00:24:56,745 --> 00:25:00,833
and if you come to search
for what is love

533
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:07,214
then may you find it
may you find it at any cost

534
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:13,887
go now
you'll go, but don't just hide

535
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:19,935
never leave this
never leave this town

536
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,522
of the parade
