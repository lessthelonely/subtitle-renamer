1
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,550
We're very different,
but I think that we bring out

2
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:12,387
the best in each other.

3
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:15,724
It's like you're chocolate
and I'm Mr. Peanutbutter.

4
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:19,019
Shut up and kiss me,
you silly goof.

5
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:25,150
Cut! [Buzzer sounds]

6
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:27,569
Welcome back to excess hollywoo.

7
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,489
I'm a Ryan seacrest type,
and I'm visiting the set

8
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,741
of Mr. Peanutbutter's hollywoo heist.

9
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:35,369
I'm thrilled to be talking
to the star of the film,

10
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:38,372
bojack horseman, and his
real life inspiration,

11
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:39,581
Mr. Peanutbutter.

12
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,291
Am I an inspiration?

13
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,978
Well, that depends
on how you define...

14
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:45,295
- Wait a minute. Yes, I am.
- Ugh.

15
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,464
You know, I'm just over
the moon to be producing

16
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,967
this movie
about my daring exploit.

17
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,970
- Yes, your daring exploit.
- Yes.

18
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,764
It's such a treat to be
shooting in my very own casa.

19
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:59,643
And it's an even sweeter treat
to be played by my good amigo...

20
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,228
Dare I say best amigo?

21
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,105
- You "daren't."
- We're so in tune.

22
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:07,943
We even finish each other's...

23
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,861
Sentences.

24
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,238
Sometimes it doesn't happen.

25
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:12,406
- It never...
- Happens.

26
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:15,033
Ah, see? I'm inside him.

27
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,286
Bojack, you haven't worked
in quite some time.

28
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,162
In fact,
I thought you were dead.

29
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:22,291
You must be so grateful to be
working again and also alive,

30
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,334
which, again,
I thought you were not.

31
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,861
How did you get involved
with this?

32
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,004
Well...

33
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,314
You want me to play
Mr. Peanutbutter

34
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,966
in the story he stole from me?

35
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:32,342
I stole the d,

36
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,303
and then he stole
my stealing of it.

37
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,805
That makes him an idea thief,
which is much less cool

38
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,807
than a thiefthief,
which is what I am

39
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:39,974
and what he also is.

40
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,351
You know what might help?

41
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:42,954
If you think about this
like a professional

42
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:44,396
instead of a big titty baby.

43
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,607
This movie is
a huge opportunity.

44
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:50,110
Quentin tarantulino is known
for revitalizing dead careers.

45
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,112
This could do for you
what reservoir dogs

46
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,447
did for rin tin tin.

47
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,073
But isn't there any other part?

48
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,825
I could play myself.

49
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,595
No, bojack's already being
played by Wallace Shawn.

50
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,621
What? The short guy
from the Princess bride

51
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:01,955
who says "inconceivable"?

52
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,291
- Why Wallace Shawn?
- Bojack horseman?

53
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,698
I don't want to play that boob.

54
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,294
I'm trying to help
you out, Wally.

55
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,921
You're the one who keeps
buying expensive rothkos.

56
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,673
I have a disease.

57
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,052
Would you tell an alcoholic
to stop buying alcohol?

58
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,179
You know,
black and blue number 7's

59
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:18,722
going up for auction next week.

60
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:20,265
Fine. I'll do the dumb movie.

61
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,059
Fine. I'll do the dumb movie.

62
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,454
But if you find me in a bathtub
with open wrists tomorrow

63
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,772
and the words "I hate my agent"
smeared across the walls

64
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,523
in blood, you'll know why.

65
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,152
So obviously I'm thrilled
to be here, just thrilled.

66
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,155
[Funky electronic music]

67
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:28,749
Cast and crew only.

68
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,669
I know you're
just doing your job,

69
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:34,214
but I live here, and the crew
has been here since 3:00 A.M.,

70
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,757
so I'm a little tired.

71
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,843
Cast and crew only.

72
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,344
Hey, stranger.

73
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,030
Haven't really seen you
since the wedding.

74
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,854
Kind of feels like we're
coming back to school

75
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,182
- after summer vacation.
- Yeah.

76
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,851
I'll see you at the pep rally.

77
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,912
Hope we don't get Mrs. Kirkman
for trig this year.

78
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,147
Yeah, well, I hope
the cheerleaders don't stuff me

79
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,482
in a locker and write
"virgin slut" on my forehead,

80
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,419
and then when I ask how
I could be both a virgin

81
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,153
and a slut,
they make me eat a lipstick.

82
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,198
So what have you been up to
these last couple months?

83
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,201
Well, I've been pretty busy.
Met a girl at soho house.

84
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,828
- Was she your waitress?
- Yes.

85
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,371
Then I met a girl at mastro's.

86
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:07,956
- Was she also your waitress?
- Yes.

87
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:09,392
Then I met a girl
at p.F. Chang's.

88
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,792
Let me guess. She was your...

89
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,794
A hooker, yes,
but what she really wants to do

90
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,546
- is wait tables.
- [Laughs]

91
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,590
Well, I, for one,
would love to meet

92
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,037
the aspiring food-service worker

93
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,801
who finally gets you
to settle down.

94
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,887
What?
Why would I want to settle down?

95
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,222
I'm 50.

96
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,683
- Yeah, anyway...
- So I'm sending the first draft

97
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,250
of the book to pinky
this afternoon.

98
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,771
- What? It's done?
- Not yet. Almost.

99
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,482
I'm excited for you to read it,

100
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,484
but I'm also
cripplingly nervous.

101
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,444
I actually kind of feel
like throwing up,

102
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,380
but I can't throw up because
I haven't had anything to eat

103
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,406
because this lady won't let me
in my own kitchen.

104
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,116
Cast and crew only.

105
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,303
Listen, if reading a book
you wrote is anywhere near

106
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,370
as great as it is
to actually spend time with you,

107
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,498
I'm sure
it's gonna be wonderful.

108
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,625
Having said that,
what do I know about books?

109
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,668
I'm just a dumb actor.

110
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,882
I'm here with hollywoo darling
Naomi watts.

111
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,301
Tell me, what attracted you
to the role of Diane?

112
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,053
I just keep getting pigeonholed

113
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,597
as these complex characters
in highly acclaimed movies.

114
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,682
For once, I would just love
to phone it in

115
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,726
and play a two-dimensional girl
in a ram com

116
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,520
with no inner life of her own.

117
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,939
That's kind of the reason
I got into this business.

118
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,899
Ha ha! You said words.

119
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:19,444
Now, is it true you stay
in character between takes?

120
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:22,155
0h, we all do.
The director insists upon it.

121
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,866
He even has everyone
calling me Diane

122
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,827
to help me get in the headspace.

123
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,453
It's been great.

124
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,620
Diane, looking good.

125
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,540
- Um, thanks.
- Ugh, not you.

126
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:32,706
I was talking to Diane.

127
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,084
Oh, thank you.

128
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,353
Now, where's my peanut butter?

129
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,670
Right over here, q.

130
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:37,939
No, I'm looking
for peanut butter.

131
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,297
Oh, you mean bojack?

132
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,258
If I wanted bojack,
I would call bojack.

133
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,260
Did someone call for bojack?

134
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:46,179
It really cuts
down on confusion.

135
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:51,768
Ah, show business,
the great equalizer.

136
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,478
Is that what it is?

137
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,105
Todd, spritz me.

138
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,566
- Spritzing.
- Mm, mm, mm.

139
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,984
Well spritzed.

140
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,777
Have you ever been
on a movie set before?

141
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,612
No, sir, Mr. Peanutbutter.

142
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:06,116
Please, Mr. Peanutbutter
was my father's name.

143
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,243
- Uh...
- And it's also my name!

144
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,536
[Buzzer sounds]

145
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,204
Ooh, speaking
of Mr. Peanutbutter,

146
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,873
I'll be back in a jiff, skippy.

147
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,916
Keep that air spritzed for me.

148
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,585
Aloha, kemosabe.

149
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,129
Hey, allow me to put
on my producer hat

150
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,423
and produce you
just for one second here.

151
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,884
I have a few notes
on how you're playing me.

152
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,136
Let's see. [Humming]

153
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,138
Problems, problems, problems,
ah, here we go.

154
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:30,891
I find it really troubling
that my movie self

155
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,393
is wearing a crew-neck t-shirt.
[Laughs]

156
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,895
I only wear v-necks.

157
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,438
You see the problem.

158
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,249
- I do not.
- I just think if we're telling

159
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,313
the story, we should tell it
how it really happened.

160
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,652
Yeah, this whole story
isn't how it really happened.

161
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,529
Right...

162
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:45,989
Because of the shirts.

163
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,657
Because I'm the one
who stole the d.

164
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:48,992
I'm the real hero here.

165
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,679
My life is full
of exciting adventures.

166
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:51,827
I should write a book.

167
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,413
Oh, wait. I did.

168
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,040
Suck on that, society.

169
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,583
Hey, you're in a mood.

170
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,293
Perhaps the tightness
of that crew neck

171
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,378
is cutting off circulation
to the brain?

172
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,088
Let me talk to Donna
in wardrobe.

173
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,590
We're gonna fix this, buddy.

174
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:04,757
Donna!

175
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,512
What are you doing?

176
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,682
I'm just trying to get inside
my character, which is you.

177
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,184
Is this how we move our arms?

178
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,644
We're so weird.

179
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,937
Is this really necessary?

180
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,563
Is this really necessary?

181
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,890
That's not what I sound like.

182
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,691
That's not mut mi sound Mike.

183
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,693
Hey, what's it been like
since we got married?

184
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,071
Is it everything we dreamed
of since we were little?

185
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,989
When I was little,
I dreamed of getting

186
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,236
a MacArthur Grant for my zine
about how all the girls

187
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,618
at school were bitches.

188
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,079
- Oh.
- Look, the wedding was great.

189
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,122
But that's not real life.

190
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,749
I mean,
I guess I got a happy ending,

191
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,751
but every happy ending
has the day after

192
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,002
the happy ending, right?

193
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,212
And the day after that.

194
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,547
So the wedding was so much fun.

195
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,074
It was the happiest day
of my life.

196
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,634
But, you know,
what does that say

197
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,719
about all the days I have left?

198
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:50,929
Whoa.

199
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:54,307
We're such a Zoe.

200
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,143
Oh, Todd, glad you're here.

201
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,310
Hold this.

202
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,133
Todd, my jacket is on the floor.

203
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,591
You're supposed to hold
the jacket

204
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,066
so it doesn't go on the floor.

205
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:06,403
Hey, sorry, bojack...
I mean, Mr. Peanutbutter.

206
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,863
But I work
for Mr. Peanutbutter now.

207
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,783
- I mean, uh, Mr. Peanutbutter.
- Ugh.

208
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,552
I can't believe
I'm on a movie set, you know?

209
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,079
I mean, this is my first chance
to work on something big

210
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,748
since my rock opera fell apart.

211
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:22,210
Man, I really messed up
that huge career opportunity

212
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:23,378
all on my own, didn't I?

213
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:29,884
Nothing sabotaged me one bit.

214
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,051
Yep.

215
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,136
You said it.

216
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,597
Well, see you later.

217
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,850
[Indistinct chatter]

218
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,309
Where can I grab a nosh?

219
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,353
Oh, craft services
is in the kitchen.

220
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,623
Up the driveway, through
the living room, make a left.

221
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,487
- Can't miss it.
- I'm gonna grab a quick bite.

222
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,985
Don't do anything stupid
while I'm gone.

223
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,237
Okay, fellas, here's the thing
about the story.

224
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,613
I don't buy it.

225
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,073
It's like something's missing,

226
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,800
but I can't put
any of my fingers on it.

227
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,785
Um, maybe once
we add the music...

228
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,138
The music? Are you kidding me?

229
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,288
Music? You're fired.

230
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,682
What dumb shit brought
this dumb shit?

231
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:00,706
Okay, you're fired too.

232
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,000
Oh, okay.

233
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,627
Anyone else
got any bright ideas?

234
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,004
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

235
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,923
Hey, maybe it make it
more Diane-y?

236
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,967
- Um, excuse me?
- I don't know.

237
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,178
This is probably stupid,
but the whole story's

238
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,472
about how this guy's
in love with this lady, right?

239
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,850
But we don't even know
who she is or what she wants.

240
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,311
I mean, maybe give her
more lines or words

241
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,188
or, I don't know,
feelings or whatever?

242
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:24,772
What?

243
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,733
He's new.
He doesn't know the rules.

244
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,110
Forgive him, mighty Caesar.

245
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:33,907
[Clapping hands]

246
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,533
Yes. Yeah.

247
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,700
I love you.

248
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:37,785
Who is this kid?

249
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,037
You're a genius.

250
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:40,347
- I'm gonna kiss your face.
- What?

251
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,207
Oh! [Laughs]

252
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,625
Come back to my web.

253
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,072
Let's talk
about Diane's feelings

254
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,503
and make this baby sing.

255
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,005
Hey, Todd, talk to him
about the wardrobe,

256
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,007
specifically the top half
of the wardrobe,

257
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,885
specifically the shirt part
of the top half of the wardrobe,

258
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:57,138
specifically the neck part of
the shirt part of the wardrobe.

259
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,182
[Cell phone rings]

260
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,642
Ugh. What now?

261
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,435
I'm sick
of this dog and pony show.

262
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,978
The movie is dumb.

263
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,915
Mr. Peanutbutter is annoying
the shit out of me,

264
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,541
and there's too much honeydew
in the fruit bowl.

265
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,067
Blech. Honeydew
is garbage fruit.

266
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,277
Also, why is bojack
being played by an old, nebbishy

267
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,444
five-foot-tall bald guy?

268
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:13,729
Is that how the world sees me?

269
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:14,905
Oh, I see.

270
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,283
So I can play
Vanya on 42nd street,

271
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,286
but I'm not a deft-enough talent
to capture the essence

272
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,372
of the elusive bojack horseman.

273
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:26,459
So sorry to offend you, sir.

274
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,378
I'm just glad my book's
coming out soon

275
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,338
so people will get
an opportunity to see

276
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:31,881
the real bojack horseman.

277
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,508
Oh, are you coming out
with a book?

278
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:34,801
You never mentioned it.

279
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,195
Plus, Todd's being super weird.

280
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:37,219
I think he's onto me.

281
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,423
Onto you in regards to what?

282
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,014
Oh, right, I didn't tell you.

283
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,684
I sabotaged his rock opera
by getting him readdicted

284
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,870
to a video game because
I didn't want him to move out.

285
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,479
Jesus Christ, bojack.

286
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,690
Anyway, I think he knows
and might be plotting

287
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,150
to sabotage me back.

288
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,026
Why is it that 90%
of oui' conversations

289
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,237
these days revolve around
plotting sabotages?

290
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,090
Are you saying I should
plot a countersabotage?

291
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,824
No, no more plotting.

292
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,118
Just be a good soldier
and do your job.

293
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,494
Nobody is out to get you.

294
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,661
[Cell phone beeps]

295
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,247
Have you seen the new draft?

296
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,332
They took it all off you
and put it on me.

297
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,709
What?

298
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:10,211
Apparently some dickweed
named Todd

299
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,505
decided I should be
three-dimensional

300
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,424
and you should have no lines.

301
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,467
Ugh. Isn't this town sick
of creating

302
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,761
three-dimensional roles
for women?

303
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,597
This happens to me all the time!

304
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,725
A.o. Scott is sick of talking
about how brilliant I am.

305

Todd.

306
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,645
I guess what I've been saying

307
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,690
for the last
seven uninterrupted minutes is,

308
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:34,694
how can I forgive my father
if I can't forgive myself?

309
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,321
True dat.

310
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,657
But none of that matters,
because we bring out

311
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,409
the best in each other.

312
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:46,080
I'm the chocolate,
and you're Mr. Peanutbutter!

313
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,249
- True dat.
- Mwah!

314
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,126
Cut! Amazing.

315
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:51,853
This is the movie
that I wanted to make.

316
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:53,337
This is gonna be great.

317
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,316
- Oh, my god, I'm so...
- Ugh, what kind of idiot

318
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,634
puts food on top of a hill?

319
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,553
Hey, so I guess now that
the movie's all about Diane,

320
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,598
I really need to dig deep
and get to know the real you.

321
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:07,227
So let's talk and talk
and talk until I am you

322
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,145
and you are nothing
but a hollowed-out husk

323
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,814
of your former self and every
thought and every feeling

324
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,693
you ever had belongs to me
and me alone.

325
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,530
So do we like sprite,
or are we more of a 7-up girl?

326
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:22,200
Uh, that all sounds great.

327
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,786
But, you know, the person
you should really be talking to

328
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,537
is that guy.

329
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,790
- Yeah, okay, I'm done.
- Diane loves talking to him.

330
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,375
They have great rapport.

331
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:34,003
In fact, Diane could spend
all day talking to him

332
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,589
and never talk to me again.

333
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:41,052
Oh, I get it, because Diane
doesn't talk to Diane.

334
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:44,180
- Diane talks to...
- Anybody else.

335
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:45,765
Hey, Todd, remember that time

336
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,392
when you wouldn't clean
up your shit?

337
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:48,851
That was hilarious.

338
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,812
- We've had some good times.
- Oh. Hi.

339
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,730
So I was thinking,
I have some...

340
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,650
[Sighs] Pretty sloppy seconds
left over from pf Chang's

341
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,628
in the fridge, and I don't think
that I want it anymore.

342
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:58,945
Maybe tonight you could eat it.

343
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,780
Friendly gesture
because we're friends.

344
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,949
- Uh...
- Oh-oh, there's my guy.

345
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,196
I heard you had a few more
thoughts about the script.

346
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,326
I do.

347
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,038
I was just thinking, what if
we made the bojack character

348
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,082
into a real shithead?

349
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,435
- Is that really necessary?
- I don't think it's necessary.

350
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:17,005
Yeah, let's... let's make him
be a real selfish asshole

351
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,257
so the audience has someone
to root against.

352
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:20,633
You're probably right.

353
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,069
Let's take another swing
at the script

354
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:23,469
and give bojack more to do.

355
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,155
Now, when you say,
"give bojack more to do"...

356
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,556
Not now, Mr. Peanutbutter.

357
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,516
And also,
now that I'm thinking about it,

358
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:32,312
why does the movie
have to take place on earth?

359
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,023
You are blowing my head.

360
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,899
- I hope you like oscars.
- Honeydew?

361
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,027
More like,
"honey, do I enjoy eating it?

362
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,945
Yes, I do." Right?

363
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,173
Not right, and I would love to
go through all the reasons why,

364
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,717
but I've got bigger concerns
right now.

365
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,784
- Honeydew, go on.
- Did you notice

366
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,721
that the Mr. Peanutbutter part
has been cut in half?

367
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,345
- What is happening to our movie?
- I thought you hated the movie.

368
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,296
Yeah, I do, but if I'm
gonna be in a dumb movie

369
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,667
I hate that makes no sense,

370
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,419
I should at least
be the star of it.

371
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,881
Look, I agree that this movie
has really lost its way.

372
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,300
I mean, first of all,
why would Mr. Peanutbutter

373
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,135
wear a crew-neck t-shirt?

374
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,804
And second of all, uh...

375
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,264
It's just the shirt, isn't it?

376
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:09,515
It doesn't make sense.

377
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,850
I'm a v-neck man.

378
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,643
A v you can put
your sunglasses in.

379
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,145
Can you do
that with a crew neck?

380
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,022
Because I'd like to see you tr...

381
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,899
Whoa.

00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,781
thanks so much for running
this scene with me.

385
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,866
I have so many lines to learn.

386
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,285
Yeah, well, most of my lines
are, "true dat,"

387
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,371
but I guess it never hurts
to practice.

388
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,499
The citizens of planet d
want their king back.

389
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,210
But I'm more concerned
with getting my self-esteem back

390
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:40,463
after being in the shadow
of powerful men for so long.

391
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,631
True dat.

392
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,038
Is it just me, or is this movie

393
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,634
kind of flying off the rails?

394
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,761
Well, I don't want to overuse
my catchphrase here,

395
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,096
but true dat.

396
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,806
This is so typical.

397
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,225
I just wanted to do something
light and fun

398
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:56,896
to distract me from the deep
well of sadness that is my life.

399
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,731
You probably
wouldn't understand.

400
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,191
Oh, puh-lease.

401
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,068
I'm so deep down
a well of sadness

is like, "damn."

Shut up and kiss me,
you miserable goof.

404
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,283
What?

405
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,328
Oh. Okay.

406
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,038
Pop this in a drawer.

407
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:16,999

Naomi, I haven't felt
like this since...

No, no, shh, shh, shh!

Okay, got my bagel.

414
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,889
Now back to work.

415
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,766
Hey, guys.

416
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,309
Hey, guys!

417
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,938
Wow, wow.

418
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,816
So you guys
really hit it off, huh?

419
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:43,317
That's awesome.

You read my mind.

423
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,867
Now, kiss me some sour cream.

424
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,827
Hey, so I finished the book

425
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,763
and sent the draft
to the publishers.

426
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:55,787
What? My book is ready?

427
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:56,932
Let me read it. Can I read it?

428
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,833
Call pinky.

429
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,936
He'll probably send you a copy
as soon as he's done with it.

430
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,420
All right! You hang tight, baby.

431
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,046
I got an instant classic
to read.

432
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,274
Keep the engine running, though,

433
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,817
because if I know me,
this book is gonna give me

434
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:07,967
a pretty big erection.

435
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,802
Okay, enjoy! Keep an open mind.

436
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,554

I should warn you,

it's not quite what we expected,
but it is good.

this could really sell.

as complex and deeply troubled

My evil plan has been defeated,
but I'll be back.

518
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:57,720
You haven't heard the last

519
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:01,015
of evil emperor
bojackitron horsemaniac.

520
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:02,182
Oh, no!

521
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,726
You shot a laser at me!

522
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,645
Oh, no! I'm dying.

523
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,105
Oh, no, I'm dead.

524
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,024
And so now that we've escaped

525
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:12,443
the evil clutches
of the emperor,

526
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:15,196
I'm free to assume
my natural form,

527
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:17,782
an all-knowing floating orb
of light?

528
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:18,948
True dat.

529
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,534
Cut, cut. [Buzzer sounds]

530
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,021
Come on, guys,
this is ridiculous.

531
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,871
Is this even a movie anymore?

532
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:26,874
Oh, maybe it isn't a movie.

533
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,502
Yeah, maybe it's
an immersive smartphone app

534
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:34,340
or a 21st-century approach
to 360-degree media envelopment.

535
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:38,302
Yeah, or maybe it's just,
like, a feeling, you know?

536
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,096
We've got work to do.
Yeah, yeah.

537
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,543
Oh, my god, this is so good.
Oh, this is gonna be awesome.

538
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:43,808
Yes! Go, Todd.

539
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,226
Hello?

540
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:46,745
Are you just gonna leave me
like this?

541
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:47,769
Anyone?

542
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,730
Ah!

543
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,190
Oh, good. You're here.

544
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,650
Oh, hi, bojack.

545
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,276
This whole day's
been a shit show.

546
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,243
The book turned out
to be a total hatchet job.

547
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,613
The movie's a disaster.

548
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,116
But thank god I have one
good thing in my life,

549
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,282
and that's you.

550
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:02,702
Bojack, I...

551
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,745
Please let me say this
before I lose my nerve.

552
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,872
I spent 50 years roaming
the countryside

553
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,125
as a wild stallion,
but I am tired of the rodeo,

554
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,085
and I'm finally ready
to saddle up.

555
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:12,252
Bojack"

556
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,713
I guess what I'm trying
to say is,

557
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,006
this mustang wants to rest
his head in the comforts

558
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,466
of your spacious barn.

559
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,759
-Uh, what?

560
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,386
I'm in love with you, Naomi.

561
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:21,721
Bojack, they fired me

562
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,390
and replaced me
with a ball on a stick.

563
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:25,557
I'm so sorry.

564
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,101
But look at the bright side.

565
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:29,454
Now you and I can just hang out
and talk about feelings.

566
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,981
No, but you're not getting it.
Boys never get it.

567
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,859
Bojack, I was in character
as Diane,

568
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:38,070
and as Diane,
we had a real connection.

569
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,698
But now that I'm off the movie,
I'm Naomi again,

570
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:44,326
and Naomi is not interested
in bojack horseman.

571
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,954
In fact,
she thinks he's kind of gross.

572
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:49,373
So I didn't fall in love
with Naomi watts?

573
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,042
You fell in love with Diane.

574
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,545
Naomi what?

575
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,255
Good-bye, bojack.

576
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,884
See? Nothing.

577
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:04,904
What's going on?
Why are they packing up?

578
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,932
Oh, glad you're here.
This is exciting.

579
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,979
Since we last talked,
this film has gone through

580
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,895
- so many permutations.
- So many.

581
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,563
First, we reimagined
the whole film

582
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,149
as an interactive
social-media experience.

583
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:16,877
Those are the dumbest words
I've ever heard.

584
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:17,901
I know.

585
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,737
So we realized it was actually

586
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,489
more of a floating
art installation,

587
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,157
but that
didn't feel right either.

588
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:24,784
We thought,
is it a high-end perfume?

589
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,702
A series of interrelated
fortune cookies?

590
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:29,705
A hat that if you turn it
upside down, it's a boat?

591
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:32,208
- No, it's none of those things.
- Exactly.

592
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,335
That's why we finally
settled on this.

593
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:35,502
Voila!

594
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:36,921
What am I looking at?

595
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:40,174
It is a bimonthly curated
box of snacks.

596
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:41,501
I don't know what that means.

597
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,968
I know. It's confusing.

598
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,815
Not the bimonthly
that means twice a month,

599
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,223
the bimonthly that
means every other month,

600
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,100
and each time
it's a different box of snacks.

601
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,394
This is the future of cinema.

602
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:56,482
You guys, finally,
my story has been told.

603
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:59,360
Okay, that's a wrap, everyone.
[Claps hands]

604
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:02,363
Thanks for making
this box of snacks a reality.

605
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,530
Let's go home.

606
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:08,160
What the hell happened
to the movie?

607
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,705
Shit, there were snacks here
the whole time?

608
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:12,872
Not bad.

609
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,458
- Whoa!
- Look, I get it.

610
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,225
You destroyed my big chance
at a comeback

611
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,053
as revenge for what I did
to your rock opera.

612
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:21,715
Revenge? Oh, that would have
been such a good idea.

613
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,008
Damn it, Todd!

614
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,969
Look, I figured out
what you did,

615
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,680
but I've been trying to put it
behind me and do my job.

616
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:30,307
So cutting my part down
was not about revenge?

617
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:33,644
And making bojack the villain
of your movie

618
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:36,313
was not a coded statement
of your feelings about me?

619
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,191
Oh, okay, great.

620
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,485
Well, I'm... I'm glad
we buried the hatchet

621
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:42,652
and everything's cool.

622
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:46,240
Uh, actually, you know,
everything is not cool.

623
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,784
You ruined my rock opera
by using character actress

624
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,327
margo martindale to trick me

625
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,037
into playing
an addictive video game.

626
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,956
And saying it all together
like that,

627
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:55,624
it all sounds kind of ludicrous.

628
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,460
But still, it was something
I cared about,

629
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,963
and what you did really hurt me.

630
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,215
Oh. Well, this feels shitty.

631
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,885
You sure you don't want to just
get some revenge real quick...

632
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,612
Thump me once in the stones
and then we'll be even?

633
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,346
I got to go.

634
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:13,517
I've got some artisanal popcorns
to Gauge the mouth feel of.

635
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:15,269
- Hey, bojack.
- Yeah?

636
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:16,562
You want an apple fritter?

637
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,272
Uh, sure.

638
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:19,940
Yeah, I bet you would.
[Laughter]

639
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,525
I bet you'd like
an apple fritter.

640
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,527
Yeah, an apple fritter
would be great.

641
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,988
Why? What... what...
What's happening here?

642
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,574
"Five shocking facts
from new bojack book"?

643
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,117
No.

644
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:32,828
Um, everyone,
please turn off your Internet.

645
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:34,288
It has gone bad.

646
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:37,041
I repeat,
the Internet has gone foul.

647
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,043
- What a loser.
- I'm glad I'm not that guy.

648
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,649
Give me your phones.
I'm a celebrity.

649
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:41,921
You have to listen to me.

650
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,714
Look at his deep well
of sadness.

651
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:45,674
It's hilarious.

652
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,010
Don't look at me.
I'm well-adjusted.

653
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:50,304
You all want my life. [Laughter]

654
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:51,847
Uh, what the hell?

655
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,700
I know, I know.
But if you just listen for...

656
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:55,285
You posted your dumb little
book on the Internet.

657
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:57,061
No, I just leaked
the first couple chapters,

658
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,812
and people are already talking
about it.

659
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,941
This is wildly unprofessional.
Who do you think you are?

660
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,044
I know you're mad,
and you have every right to be,

661
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:05,670
but you got to read
some of these comments.

662
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:06,987
People love you.

663
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,381
And they're gonna love you
even more

664
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,199
when they read the rest
of my book.

665
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:11,992
- Your book?
- Our book.

666
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,744
Nobody is gonna read that book.

667
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:15,111
How do you still not get that?

668
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,164
It is never going
to be published.

669
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:19,541
Bojack, I stand by my work.

670
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,377
This is a really good book.

671
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:24,713
And if you just give it time,
youfllsee.

672
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,507
[Sighs]

673
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:27,883
Maybe you're right.

674
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,176
Really?

675
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:31,053
No. You're fired.

676
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,430
J“ back in the '903 j”

677
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:38,394
j“ I was in a very famous TV show j“

678
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:43,315
- j“ I'm bojack the horse j“
- I bojack j“

679
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:44,733
j“ bojack the horse j”

680
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,027
j“ don't act like you don't know I

681
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:53,826

682
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:58,622

don't think I'm gonna last j“

683
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:02,418

684
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:06,839
j“ that I'm more horse than a man j“

685
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:11,051

686
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,387
j“ bojack j“

687
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,224
